// command: run tsc --build across every package under packages/ in dependency order
// Build every package under `packages/` — `pnpm run build`.
//
// `tsc --build` is given all the package directories at once, so it resolves their `references` itself and
// builds in dependency order. That is the whole reason there is no hand-written solution file: a list of
// projects in a `tsconfig.build.json` is one more thing that can go stale against `packages/`, and this repo
// has already paid for that class of mistake (a fix applied at one call site when the behaviour reached
// several). Discovery cannot drift.
//
// `tsconfig.json` at the root is untouched and stays `noEmit: true`: it type-checks `src/` as one program for
// `pnpm run typecheck` and the editor, and must keep working unchanged while packages are extracted one at a
// time (PLAN.md M2-M8).
