// command: turn a nightly coverage.yml failure comment into an actual finding, not just 'it failed'
// A NIGHTLY FAILURE COMMENT THAT SAYS "coverage failed" IS NOT A FINDING -- #169, coverage.yml's own
// reader.
//
// #166 moved `npm run coverage` off the PR path and onto a nightly `coverage.yml`, which comments on #169
// when it goes red -- the same pattern `board-liveness.yml` uses against #20, "a schedule nobody reads is
// a gate that fails quietly." But `if: failure()` on the whole job fires identically whichever of THREE
// unrelated things happened, and the comment it posted named none of them:
//
//   - `npm ci` or `npm run build` failed -- an INFRASTRUCTURE problem. Coverage was never measured at
//     all, and there is nothing here about the repository's test coverage to act on.
//   - a TEST failed -- node's test runner exits non-zero on a real assertion failure, which c8 propagates
//     as ITS OWN exit code. That is a test regression, not a coverage regression, and reads #169's own
//     purpose backwards if reported as one.
//   - c8 itself found a metric below `.c8rc.json`'s threshold -- THE ACTUAL FINDING this issue exists for.
//
// Collapsing three causes into one message is this repository's own most-recorded shape --
// `merge-guard.mjs` (#161) drew the identical distinction between "no check ran" and "a check failed",
// and `workflow-run-liveness.mjs` (#118) generalised it. This is the same discipline pointed at a
// different silence: a comment that says "failed" without saying which of three things happened is a
// comment nobody can act on without first re-deriving what the workflow already knew and threw away.
//
// PURE, so every shape is testable without a real CI run -- including the one that matters most and
// cannot be produced on demand: the real threshold-miss message, `ERROR: Coverage for lines (76.2%) does
// not meet global threshold (78%)`. That wording was c8's own, verbatim, until #1321 (rstest adoption step
// 5/5) removed c8 as a dependency; it is now `scripts/coverage.mjs`'s `thresholdMissLines` (#1320), which
// kept the wording so this regex would not need to change. `coverage-is-rstest.test.ts` pins that coupling
// end to end.

// failure cleanly -- and if `npm ci` never succeeded, the workspace symlink the package specifier resolves
// through was never created. A relative import to plain `.mjs` source costs nothing and cannot fail this

 * `/ℹ fail (\d+)/` is the **spec** reporter's glyph, which is the default on a TTY and on node 24. CI is
 * neither: it runs node 22 with no TTY, where the default is **TAP**. Measured on both, same command shape:
 *
 *     node 22, TAP     not ok 2 - fails on purpose      # fail 1
 *     node 24, spec    ✖ fails on purpose (0.36ms)      ℹ fail 1
 *
 * So `testsFailed` was **0 for every CI run there has ever been**, and run 34677157881's single, named
 * failure classified as CANNOT TELL. The unit tests passed because the fixture was typed from what the
 * author's terminal showed -- a fixture in a format the producer does not emit here.
 *
 * `not ok` is NOT the answer on its own, and I measured that rather than taking it: the spec reporter
 * prints `✖`, never `not ok`. **Both are read, and so are both summary lines.**
