# THE REPOSITORY IS READ, NOT WRITTEN DOWN. This said `a11ign/a11ign` literally -- the name the project
# takes at the transfer -- so the chairman's fetch printed "release not found" against a repository that
# does not exist yet. `repo-identity.ts` is the one place that name lives and the one value that flips at
# the transfer; a second copy here is the fact-stated-twice shape with a date attached, and it was already
# wrong before the date arrived.

# The rename (#66) carried this folder from `a11y-witness-board-reports` to `a11ign-board-reports`
# along with every other occurrence of the old name -- correctly for the tree, and wrongly for this one
# line, because the chairman has read every edition out of the old folder and nobody asked them.
#
# A rename sweep is exactly the change that cannot tell a name we own from a name we do not. This is the
# one path in the repository that writes to a person's own filesystem, so it is the one that had to be
# excluded, and it was the one nobody looked at.
#
# Overridable, defaulting to the folder that has always been there: the default is the chairman's, and
# anyone wanting it elsewhere says so rather than being moved.
