// command: run only the tests a change can reach -- the local half of CI's scoped selection
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `select-changed-tests.mjs` has picked the reachable tests since #1160, and `ci.yml`'s
// `ts` job uses it -- but there was no npm entry, so locally the only choices were `pnpm run test:org`
// (8m57s, measured on a 14-core Mac) or nothing. That is why a development loop reached for the
// nine-minute command: it was the only one there.
//
// WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DO, stated because the number surprises people. On a one-file change it selects
// 17 tests PRECISELY and then adds ~173 always-run guards, because -- in the selector's own words -- "a
// guard whose population is the tree imports nothing from the file it governs, so no selection can reach
// it". So this is roughly half the suite, not a handful: about 190 files of 373. It is a real halving of
// the loop and it is NOT a path to seconds; the tree-walking guards are always-run by design and their
// cost is a separate piece of work.
//
// BROAD FALLS BACK TO EVERYTHING, never to a narrow run. When the diff touches ci.yml or a root config the
// selector reports BROAD and names no files, because a change there can reach anything. Answering that
// with a small set would be the "empty must read as run everything" defect the selector itself names.
