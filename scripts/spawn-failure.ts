/**
 * #1293: A FAILED SPAWN, DESCRIBED IN ONE LINE THAT CARRIES BOTH HALVES.
 *
 * Two facts make a spawn failure actionable: WHICH command died (the argv) and WHY (the child's stderr).
 * Which of the two a caller is missing depends entirely on how it spawned, and until this file every
 * script in `scripts/` decided that by accident of how its own `run` was written:
 *
 *   stdio "inherit"  -> the cause is already on screen above; the failure line must add the ARGV
 *   stdio "pipe"     -> the cause was captured, not shown; the failure line must add the STDERR
 *
 * #1283 settled the first for `pr-open` (gh's stderr is inherited, so the line names the argv). #1246's
 * batch push settled nothing: 91 refused pushes logged `Command failed: git … push …` and not one said why.
 *
 * WHAT NODE ACTUALLY THROWS, measured on node v22 before this was written (and pinned by the test, so a
 * Node that changes it is noticed): a PIPED `execFileSync` failure appends the child's whole stderr to
 * `error.message`, after the argv line -- so the incident's log must have kept only the message's FIRST
 * line, which is exactly the argv. An INHERITED failure's message is the argv alone and `stderr` is
 * `null`. A command that never started (`ENOENT`) has no stderr and a different message entirely. So this
 * reads the argv from the message's first line ONLY -- taking the whole message would print the stderr
 * twice, which is how a three-line refusal became twenty-four (#1277).
 *
 * THREE ABSENCES, THREE STRINGS. "It wrote nothing to stderr", "its stderr was not captured" and "it never
 * started" are different facts about a failure, and a reader acting on the line needs to know which.
 *
 * `code` IS NOT "NEVER STARTED" (worker-judge's blocker on #1301, reproduced). Node sets `code` with a null
 * `status` for a child that never ran (`ENOENT`: `pid` 0, no signal) AND for a child it started and then
 * KILLED -- `ENOBUFS` when output passed `maxBuffer` (#1244's own failure), `ETIMEDOUT` past `timeout`. A
 * killed child has a real `pid`, a `signal`, and possibly stderr worth its last line; only the first case
 * is "never started". The PID is what separates them: only a spawn that never ran has pid 0. The signal does
 * NOT -- a child that TRAPS Node's SIGTERM exits with a status, and its error carries a code, a status and no
 * signal (worker-judge, second blocker: I had called that shape unmeasured when I had only not written it).
 * A stopped child names its code as WHY, whether it died of the signal or exited on it.
