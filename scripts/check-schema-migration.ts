// @ts-check
// command: refuse a release while a declared schema migration is still open
/**
 * A declared schema migration may exist on a branch. It may never be released.
 *
 * `scorer-artifact.test.ts` asserts the committed weights carry the schema the committed feature pipeline
 * computes, because a consumer cloning a ref where they disagree cannot score anything at all. That is the
 * right invariant for what SHIPS, and the wrong one for a branch that is deliberately changing the schema
 * ahead of a retrain: there, the two disagree for hours by design.
 *
 * The old way through was `A11Y_SKIP_VERIFY=1`, and the cost of that is not the one guard it was aimed at —
 * it disables the ENTIRE pre-push hook, so lint, typecheck, 949 tests, check-signals and rules:gate all stop
 * running too. A skip used on every push is a hook nobody has.
 *
 * So the divergence is DECLARED in the tree instead, in `models/schema-migration.json`, naming both versions.
 * The test then accepts a divergence that the declaration describes exactly, and still fails an undeclared one
 * or a declaration that does not match reality. This script is the other half: release refuses while the
 * declaration exists, so the state cannot reach a consumer.
