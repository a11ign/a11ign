// @ts-check
// command: the whole-repo coverage gate `pnpm run coverage` runs, now through rstest, not c8
//
// #1320, STEP 4 OF THE RSTEST ADOPTION (#1317): coverage moves off c8 onto `@rstest/coverage-v8`. Three
// pieces, each already built and tested for a reason of its own, wired together here for the first time:
//
//   - THE SAME VACUITY FLOOR `test:ts`/`test:all` use (#355/#1319) -- `assert-glob-not-empty.mjs`, run as a
//     CHECK ONLY, never `--run`: the real run below is rstest's own, over the population `.c8rc.json`
//     already declares, and passing that population to the floor a second time would be a second copy of
//     the same fact typed twice.
//   - `scripts/rstest/merge-child-coverage.mjs` (#1350), UNCHANGED and run exactly as its own header
//     documents: it runs the suite under rstest with coverage and folds in what a spawned `node` child
//     covered, so a script `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` would otherwise miss does not read 0%.
//   - THE THRESHOLD, CHECKED HERE, AFTER THE MERGE -- never by rstest's own `--coverage.thresholds`. That
//     would gate the PRE-MERGE report, where every file #1350 exists to fix still reads 0%: exactly the
//     numbers the merge corrects. So this script re-derives the same totals `coverage-final.merged.json`
//     already holds, through the same `CoverageProvider` the merge itself uses, and compares them against
//     `.c8rc.json`'s own `lines`/`statements` numbers -- the same 78 c8 enforced, read once, never retyped.
//
// THE THRESHOLD-MISS MESSAGE IS c8's OWN WORDING, VERBATIM: `ERROR: Coverage for <metric> (<pct>%) does not
// meet threshold (<pct>%)`. `scripts/coverage-failure-classifier.mjs` (#169) parses exactly this shape out of
// nightly's captured log to tell a real regression from a test failure, against a regex that was pinned to
// c8's own installed source until #1321 (rstest adoption step 5/5) removed c8 as a dependency -- reusing the
// wording here is what keeps that classifier working without editing it, now that this function is the
// wording's only producer. The coupling is pinned in `coverage-is-rstest.test.ts`.
//
// EXCLUDED FROM ITS OWN COVERAGE MEASUREMENT (`.c8rc.json`, which already names this file) for the same
// reason `scripts/build-packages.mjs` is: it spawns the test runner, so measuring the measurer is circular.
//
// RELATIVE IMPORTS, NOT `@a11ign/worker-fleet/cli-flags` -- a root script, the same rule `build-packages.mjs`
// and `coverage-failure-classifier.mjs` give for their own identical choice.
