// command: check-transfer-urls -- walk the tree for every URL naming PRODUCT_REPO (a11ign/a11ign) and
//   fetch each one, printing the count and every non-200 by file:line. Run on transfer day (2026-09-15,
//   #63) and paste the output on #524.
//
// #524: every public doc URL naming a11ign/a11ign is a 404 today, and nothing tracked that interval.
// `repo-identity-consolidated.test.ts` and the `action-reference` check correctly pin PRODUCT_REPO into
// badges/security/provisioning URLs and REPO into `uses:` lines as two DELIBERATELY different values
// (#66) -- that split is right and stays right until the transfer (#63) actually happens. This is not a
// test of that split; it is the thing nothing else does: PROVE the interval has closed, on the day it is
// supposed to, by actually fetching what the docs tell a reader to fetch.
//
// THE POPULATION IS DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED -- the same shape `documented-checkout-step.test.ts` was
// corrected into after missing a real file on its first pass (#491). A hand-written file list is the
// "nobody updates it" shape; this walks the whole tree and finds every `github.com/a11ign/a11ign` and
// `raw.githubusercontent.com/a11ign/a11ign` URL wherever it appears -- `package.json` `repository`/
// `homepage` fields, workflow/prose sites the earlier consolidated test already tracks, and ansible/
// provisioning files that test never reads.
//
// REFUSES RATHER THAN PASSES ON ABSENCE, in two distinct ways this repo has paid for before:
//   - zero URLs found at all is a broken discovery pattern, not an empty tree -- refused, exit 2.
//   - a URL that could not be REACHED (DNS failure, timeout, no network) is a different fact from a URL
//     that resolved and answered non-200. Collapsing them is the exact "a checker that silently skips on
//     a fetch error" shape CLAUDE.md names as its own most expensive recurring defect one layer over --
//     reported separately below, and any unreachable URL refuses the whole run (exit 3) rather than
//     reporting a false "all clean" alongside the ones that did answer.
//
// Not wired into any CI job. `docs/pipeline.md` documents the real `acceptance` job as depth-1 with no
// network path assumed reliable for an external fetch sweep across 30+ live URLs on every push -- this is
// a DECISION VERIFICATION for one date, not a continuous gate, and `ceo`'s ruling on #524 names it as the
// transfer-day check to run and paste, not a thing to automate into a job that fires forever after.
//
// THIS SCRIPT CHECKS URLS, NOT MENTIONS -- 29 URLs across 22 files, not the 34 files the #524 audit
// counted. The gap is twelve files that name `a11ign/a11ign` as a bare STRING with no fetchable URL
// attached: `PLAN.md`'s historical prose, `.agent-org/roles/README.md`, `repo-identity.ts`'s own declaration,
// three consistency tests (`action-reference`, `repo-identity-consolidated`, `documented-checkout-step`)
// that reference `PRODUCT_REPO` via the IMPORTED CONSTANT rather than a literal, and six more docs
// mentioning the org in passing. Nothing there for a fetch to check -- that population is `repo-identity-
// consolidated.test.ts`'s own job, proving those sites still agree with the constant, which needs no
// network at all. "29 URLs checked" and "34 files name the org" are both correct and are answers to
// different questions; naming both here is what stops the smaller number reading as an undercount.
