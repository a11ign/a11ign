// command: regenerate docs/commands.md from every script's own `// command:` header
//
// A COMMAND NOBODY CAN FIND IS A COMMAND NOBODY RUNS -- A6b, #478. `commands-documented.test.ts` used to
// answer "is this command documented?" by grepping CLAUDE.md/README/docs/ for the NAME, which cannot see
// the 24 scripts under `scripts/` that have no `package.json` entry at all (A3, #454) -- 20 of them were
// undocumented and invisible to that check by construction, because nothing forced a script to declare
// anything before it could be run.
//
// So the check now reads a page instead of prose, and the page is BUILT FROM the scripts rather than
// written about them: every script that is a real command (see `isCommandScript` below) must carry a
// `// command: <description>` header, and a script with none fails `commands-documented.test.ts` outright
// rather than being silently excluded. The list nobody maintains is the list that cannot go stale --
// CLAUDE.md's own rule for registries, applied to documentation.
//
// WHICH SCRIPTS NEED A HEADER IS DERIVED, NOT A HAND LIST. `scripts/commands.ts`'s own header (A3) says
// "only a person can say which [.mjs files are commands]" and hand-lists four modules
// (`board-data.mjs`, `board-markdown.mjs`, `git-env.ts`, `repo-identity.ts`) that are imported and never
// run. That list did not need writing: every one of those four -- and only those four, plus this file's
// own sibling `commands.ts` -- is missing the entry-point guard every real CLI in this repo already
// carries (`if (import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(...).href) main();`, `entry-points.test.ts`'s own
// population). A module meant to be imported has no reason to guard a `main()` nothing calls directly; a
// command does. Verified against the hand list it replaces: identical five files, zero drift, computed
// rather than remembered.

 * paid for four times, arriving in the guard I had just built. Fixed per ceo/dispatcher's review: the
 * marker is written for real, and `docs/commands.md` is named explicitly in `generated-paths.test.ts`'s
 * own `TRACKED_EXEMPT` map with the reason, so the guard KNOWS this file is tracked deliberately rather
