// command: refuse with the RIGHT message when the tree carries an untracked changeset
//
// #1127: `npx changeset status --since=<base>` reads the changeset directory through git, so a
// changeset file that has not been `git add`ed does not exist to it -- and it prints the message for
// having written NONE at all ("Some packages have been changed but no changesets were found. Run
// changeset add to resolve this error."). That is the message for the wrong state: the file is there,
// correct, and one `git add` away from working. An author who has just written a changeset and is told
// none was found concludes the gate is broken, which is a night spent on `ci.yml` rather than on `git
// add .changeset/whatever.md`.
//
// RUN FROM `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`, NEVER FROM `ci.yml` -- THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS ROW GOT THAT
// WRONG, and reviewer-2's `not-convinced` on #1678 is why it moved (product-manager's independent
// confirmation, 2026-09-18). `actions/checkout` clones the PUSHED tree, and "untracked" is a property of
// a LOCAL working directory that, by definition, never survives a push -- there is no commit for an
// untracked file to ride in on. A CI step reading `git status --porcelain -- .changeset` after checkout
// would read 0 untracked files on every run, always, regardless of what the author's machine looked
// like: a check placed somewhere the state it exists to catch cannot occur. The one place this state is
// real is client-side, before the push, which is exactly what the pre-push hook is for.
//
// PURE PARSE, THEN A THIN CLI -- `untrackedChangesetReason` takes `git status --porcelain`'s own text and
// returns a message or `null`, so it is tested directly against a fixture string with no git process
// involved, the shape this repo already favours (`parseWorktreeList`, `worktreeStatus` in
// `agent-org/src/prune-worktrees.mjs` / `row-claim.mjs`).
//
// RETURNS `null` RATHER THAN THROWING WHEN NOTHING IS UNTRACKED, and that is load-bearing: the caller
// (the pre-push hook) must let the push proceed unchanged in that case. The genuine-absence message from
// `npx changeset status` itself ("no changesets were found", when none was written at all) is a
// SEPARATE, correct message this script never touches -- it only ever fires for the untracked shape.
