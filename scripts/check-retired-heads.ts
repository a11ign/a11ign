// command: refuse a candidate whose scorer head set shrank without declaring what it retired
/**
 * A candidate whose head set SHRINKS must name what it retired, or be refused.
 *
 * v19 was going to ship without `3.3.2:unnamed-form-field` — a head v18 carried, calibrated at its target
 * false-positive rate, with 165 positives in its own threshold sweep — and nothing declared it. The
 * changeset would have listed twenty per-subtype thresholds and simply had one fewer than before; the
 * promote commit message would not have mentioned it. Caught by a pre-push hook noticing, not by anything
 * asking the question, and only because two sessions spent most of an evening on it: one compared the
 * report against a file from the wrong commit and reported the promotion innocent, one read
 * `rule-ownership.json`'s `3.3.2:placeholder-only` — a DIFFERENT 3.3.2 subtype with the opposite answer —
 * and reported the loss correct. Both resolved an ambiguity by assumption inside a message asserting they
 * had checked.
 *
 * The removal itself was correct — W3C does not require a label to be ASSOCIATED for 3.3.2 (that is 1.3.1),
 * those cases always declared 4.1.2 as well, and the head was a duplicate label a deletion had not
 * finished removing. Being correct is exactly why this needs a gate: a legitimate removal, fully reasoned
 * months of context away, still cost an evening because nothing MADE the reasoning travel with the change.
 *
 * So: a head present in the SHIPPED report and absent from the CANDIDATE is a REFUSAL, never a warning —
 * the same shape `promote:gated` already uses — unless `retired-heads.json` accounts for it by name. The
 * declaration is the deliverable; the comparison (this file's `headSet`/`retiredHeadsVerdict`) is the cheap
 * part. Deliberately silent on whether a criterion SHOULD be covered — this row only asks whether a
 * disappearance was declared, never whether it was right.
