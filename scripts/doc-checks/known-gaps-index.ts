// DOC CROSS-REFERENCE CHECK (#905): `docs/known-gaps.md`'s index is a DERIVED view of its headings -- every
// open section linked, every closed or meta section not. The rule already lives in
// `scripts/known-gaps-index.ts` (the generator `known-gaps-index.test.ts` asserts on), so this composes it
// rather than restating it: a disagreement is a line the freshly built index has and the committed one lacks,
// or the reverse.
