// DOC CROSS-REFERENCE CHECK (#905): every npm script is named somewhere a human looks (or is declared internal
// with a reason), and `docs/commands.md` matches the tree's own `// command:` headers. Moved out of
// `commands-documented.test.ts`, which now asserts on these same functions; its header has the two populations
// and why each is held to a different standard. The rule that every command script CARRIES a header is a rule
// about the shape of code, not a cross-reference, and stays in the test (product-manager's ruling on #905).
