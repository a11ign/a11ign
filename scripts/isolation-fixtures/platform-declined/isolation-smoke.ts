// A smoke test that DECLINES a check this machine cannot make, by exiting 3.
//
// `nvda-worker` does this when guidepup refuses to import without a screen reader, and `worker-fleet` does it
// for a host-capacity read that is macOS-only by design. The gate must report those as SKIP rather than FAIL:
// a platform limit is not a packaging defect, and treating it as one stopped `release:gate` at its first leg
// on the only machine with the Python venv the judge needs.
//
// The package itself resolves fine, which is the point — everything checkable was checked.
