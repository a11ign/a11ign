// command: rehearse deleting non-standard refs and rewriting git history ahead of the org transfer
// ONE COMMAND FOR THE REHEARSAL -- delete non-standard refs, run the `git filter-repo` rewrite, rescan.
// #310, preparation for #63's org transfer and the repository going public.
//
// WHY THE REF-DELETION STEP EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. Measured directly: a single rewrite pass
// (either `--replace-text` or a custom `--blob-callback`, both tried) left 246 of 2,268 matches across
// 76 of 715 paths untouched -- REPRODUCIBLE on a fresh clone, unchanged by a second pass. The cause was
// one non-standard ref, `refs/codex/turn-diffs/checkpoints/...`, pointing directly at a TREE rather than
// a commit -- `git filter-repo` prints "Unexpected object of type tree, skipping" and leaves every blob
// reachable ONLY through it untouched, while `git rev-list --objects --all` (what the scanner walks)
// still finds them. `refs/kanban/checkpoints/*` and `refs/tmp/pr*` are the same shape: tool-generated,
// ephemeral, not real project history, and not worth keeping through a transfer either way. Deleting
// every ref outside `refs/heads`, `refs/remotes` and `refs/tags` before the rewrite closed the gap to
// zero, verified against this repository's own history.
//
// A FRESH CLONE, NEVER ORIGIN. This tool REFUSES to run against a target path that is not inside a temp
// directory -- the one property that distinguishes "a disposable rehearsal clone" from "the checkout you
// are standing in". The transfer itself and the force-push to origin are explicitly the owner's hands,
// not this tool's.
