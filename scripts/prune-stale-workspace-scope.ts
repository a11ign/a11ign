// command: remove a stale workspace-scope's node_modules symlinks a rename left behind
// #376: `npm install` ADDS a new workspace scope's node_modules symlinks and does not remove an old one,
// so after a rename both scopes resolve to the same packages -- a leftover `@old-scope/*` import does not
// throw `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a machine that has ever installed the previous scope, it works. It fails
// only on a fresh install (CI, a new clone, the next person who deletes node_modules), by which point the
// commit has landed. Run from `prepare`, so this fires on every plain `npm install` without anyone having
// to remember a bespoke postinstall step.
//
// DERIVED, NEVER HARD-CODED: the current scope is read from a real workspace package.json, and a stale
// scope is identified structurally -- a `node_modules/@*` directory whose members are symlinks resolving
// into this repo's own `packages/`, and that is not the current scope -- so the NEXT rename needs nothing
// edited here. A scope named `@a11y-witness` literally would answer only this rename and go quiet on the
// one after it.
//
// MUST NEVER FAIL AN INSTALL, the same rule `install-git-hooks.ts` states for itself: every failure here
// is reported and swallowed, never thrown, because a broken symlink or an unreadable directory is not a
// reason to break `npm install`.
