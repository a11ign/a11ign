// @ts-check
// command: say whether the first-publish npm token is still present after it should have been revoked
// IS THE FIRST-PUBLISH NPM TOKEN STILL THERE AFTER IT SHOULD BE GONE? — #73, built alongside #72.
//
//   npm run npm-token:check            say whether NPM_TOKEN is gone, present, or unaskable
//   npm run npm-token:check -- --post  and comment ONCE on the tracking issue if it is a real finding
//
// ## Why this is dated, and why the date does almost no work
//
// `NPM_TOKEN` is an organisation-level Actions secret on `github.com/a11ign`, created 2026-09-06 to cover
// exactly one thing: the first `npm publish` of packages that cannot yet have a trusted publisher attached,
// because npm's own docs do not say whether one can be configured before a package exists (#72). It expires
// 2026-12-05. #73 asks whether it is gone on 2026-11-20, fifteen days early on purpose — late enough that
// the first publish and the trusted-publisher configuration should both be long done, early enough that a
// "still there" finding leaves two weeks to act before the expiry becomes an outage rather than a decision.
//
// ## Why this runs on PUSH, never on a schedule — the same reason as `board-schedule-liveness.mjs`
//
// A watchdog that is itself scheduled has the disease it watches for: GitHub disables a scheduled workflow
// after 60 days without repository activity, silently, and this repo already paid once to learn that a
// third cron dies in the same breath as the two it guards. `push` cannot be disabled by inactivity, because
// a push IS the activity -- the one condition that would silence a schedule is the one condition where this
// check's silence is also correct (nobody has touched the repo, so nobody has re-created a stray token
// either). `npm-token-liveness.test.ts` pins the absence of a `schedule:` key in the workflow for the same
// reason `board-liveness.test.ts` does.
//
// ## The third state is not decoration -- it is why this script exists at all
//
// `gh secret list --org <org>` needs org-admin or a fine-grained "Organization secrets: read" permission.
// The repository's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has neither, so most runs of this check -- including, honestly,
// most runs BEFORE a human deliberately grants a scoped read credential -- will not be able to ask the
// question at all. Reading that failure as "absent" would report an unrevoked token as fine on the strength
// of a permissions error; reading it as "present" would raise a false alarm on every ordinary push. Neither
// is honest, so a failed ask is its own state, `CANNOT_TELL`, silent before the due date and loud after it
// -- the same shape #59's `mergeStatus()` uses for a `merge-base` that could not even ask the question, and
// the same reason `evidence:check` has an INCONCLUSIVE exit distinct from both SAME and CHANGED.
