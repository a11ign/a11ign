// command: does the release job need to run coverage itself, or can it reuse nightly's verdict for this sha
//
// #1308: `release.yml`'s "Coverage — the whole-repo threshold" step runs `npm run coverage` (c8 over the
// whole suite, 301s measured) EVERY release, even when `nightly.yml`'s own `coverage` job already ran the
// identical command against the EXACT SAME sha earlier that day (measured: `npm run coverage` is invoked
// once each in `release.yml` and `nightly.yml`, never in `trunk.yml` -- trunk's own verdict is `npm test`,
// the suite passing, not a coverage number, so it cannot stand in for this check). A release cut right
// after a nightly run pays for the same 301 seconds twice.
//
// READS THE COVERAGE JOB'S OWN CONCLUSION, NEVER THE RUN'S -- `nightly.yml` also runs `gateSweep`,
// `closeRowsSweep` and `watch` in the same workflow file. A sibling job failing would roll the whole RUN's
// conclusion to `failure` while `coverage` itself passed, and reading the run-level conclusion would
// refuse a genuinely reusable verdict for a reason that has nothing to do with coverage.
//
// MATCHED BY EXACT SHA, NEVER "THE LATEST NIGHTLY RUN" -- nightly runs on a schedule against whatever
// `main`'s tip happens to be at trigger time (`ref: main`, `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`), so its most
// recent run is very often the PARENT of the sha being released, not the sha itself. Reusing a parent's
// verdict would ship a coverage number that was never measured for the code actually being released.
