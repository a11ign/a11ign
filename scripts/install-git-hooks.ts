// @ts-check
// command: point git at this repo's tracked hooks; run automatically by npm install via prepare
// Point git at this repo's tracked hooks. Run by `prepare`, so `npm install` installs them.
//
// ## The hole this closes
//
// `core.hooksPath` was set in ONE checkout's `.git/config` and nothing put it there. No `prepare`, no
// `postinstall`, no line in CONTRIBUTING telling a clone to set it — so a fresh clone had the hook FILES
// and none of them running. Found 2026-09-05 by an external architecture audit.
//
// That matters more here than in most repos, because the pre-push hook is where the cheap tier of
// verification lives — lint, typecheck, unit tests, `check-signals`, `rules:gate`, measured at ~5 s — and
// the pre-commit hook is what stops a commit sweeping up another agent's half-finished work in a shared
// checkout, after one such commit took 19 files of which 16 were somebody else's. Both were, for anyone
// who had not manually configured them, decorative.
//
// ## Why `prepare` and not `postinstall`
//
// `prepare` runs on a plain `npm install` in a git checkout, which is the moment somebody starts working
// here. It does NOT run for a consumer installing a published package — the root manifest is private and
// is never published — so this cannot reach into anyone else's repository.
//
// ## It must never fail an install
//
// A tarball has no `.git`, CI may check out with none, and git may not be on PATH. None of those is a
// reason to break `npm install`, so every failure is REPORTED and swallowed. A silent success and a
// silent failure would be the same thing, which is the defect this file exists to fix — so it says which
// one happened, every time.

// `workflow-run-liveness.mjs`, which had been crashing on this same import on every run.
