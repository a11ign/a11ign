/**
 * THE ONE-LINE DISPATCHER — A3.
 *
 *   node --import tsx scripts/run.ts --list             every command this repository declares, by name
 *   node --import tsx scripts/run.ts <name> [args...]   run one, passing everything after the name through
 *
 * A command in `commands.mjs` needs no `package.json` entry, which is the whole point: 19 PRs edited
 * `package.json` for unrelated reasons, so a changeset, a dependency bump and a new script collided in one
 * file for no reason connected to any of them.
 *
 * ## IT REFUSES AN UNKNOWN NAME AND SAYS WHAT IS NEAR IT
 *
 * The same rule as `refuseUnknownFlags`: an argument the receiving thing does not recognise must never be
 * DISCARDED, because the default then runs and reports success. A mistyped command name here would
 * otherwise be a silent no-op with exit 0, which is this repository's most-recorded shape.
 *
 * ## ARGUMENTS ARE PASSED THROUGH, NEVER RE-PARSED
 *
 * `spawnSync` with an argv array, never a shell string. A command's own flags are its business, and
 * putting a shell between the operator and the command is what sent four capture shards at
 * `--worker=http://:8765` for 29 minutes.
