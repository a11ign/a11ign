// command: regenerate .github/workflows/consumer-gate.yml from README.md's own documented workflow
// #494: `action-smoke` IS GREEN AND COULD NEVER HAVE CAUGHT #491/#492/#493 -- IT HAS REPO KNOWLEDGE.
//
// `action-smoke.yml` runs `uses: ./` inside this repo's own checkout: it needs no `actions/checkout`
// step because the workspace already IS the repository, it never reads the public documents, and it
// never forms an expectation the output could disappoint. The V1 rehearsal (#324) proved that gap three
// times on a real windows-2022 runner: a fresh reader following only the public docs got an empty
// workspace (no `actions/checkout` in any of them), the build died on Windows, and the failure message
// lied about where the report was.
//
// This generates a workflow whose STEPS are the ones a reader would actually copy -- extracted from
// README.md's own Quickstart fence, not hand-retyped, so it cannot silently drift from what the README
// says. Two rules keep it honest:
//
//   1. NOTHING IS ADDED THE DOCUMENT DOES NOT GIVE. If README.md's fence has no `actions/checkout` step,
//      the generated workflow has none either, and the gate must fail on windows-2022 for the identical
//      reason a reader's own workflow would -- `setup-node`'s `cache: npm` dying on "lock file not
//      found" (#491). Adding a checkout step here "to make it pass" is `action-smoke` with more steps.
//   2. ONLY the `url`/`task` VALUES are substituted, never a key added or removed. The README's own
//      values are illustrative placeholders (`https://example.com/checkout`, `https://your-site.example`)
//      that cannot actually be captured; a real, stable public page is substituted so the gate can
//      produce a genuine report, exactly as `action-smoke.yml` substitutes a real W3C page for "your
//      site". Every other line — whether a checkout step exists, the exact `uses:` ref — passes through
//      unedited.
//
// PINNED TO THIS COMMIT, NOT `@main` -- #494's own acceptance. A tag that moves makes the test's subject
// change under it.
//
// PINNED AS A LITERAL SHA, NOT AN EXPRESSION -- `uses:` steps do not accept `${{ }}` at all ("no context
// is available here", verified with `actionlint` before trusting it). `release.yml` gets its "runs
// against the exact sha this workflow was dispatched at" property from a DIFFERENT mechanism --
// `uses: ./.github/workflows/action-smoke.yml` calls another workflow in this SAME repo, which GitHub
// always resolves at the calling workflow's own ref; that mechanism does not extend to an ACTION
// reference inside a step. So the sha is resolved HERE, at generation time (`git rev-parse HEAD`), and
// baked in as a literal string -- the same MECHANISM `docs/commands.md` (A6b, #478) established for a
// generated-and-tracked file, but see #558 immediately below for where the analogy stops: unlike a plain
// markdown doc, this file EMBEDS a reference to its own future commit, which changes what `--check` can
// actually prove.
//
// #558, PART 1: `--check` USED TO ALSO REQUIRE THE PIN TO EQUAL HEAD, AND THAT IS UNSATISFIABLE IN ANY
// COMMITTED TREE. Regenerate at HEAD `X` and the file pins `X`; commit that file and HEAD becomes the NEW
// commit `Y` (the one containing the change) -- the committed pin can never equal HEAD by the time
// anything reads it back. Measured directly: `release.yml`'s own `--check` gate step failed on a freshly
// cloned `main`, on a commit that had JUST regenerated correctly. `main()`'s `--check` mode now compares
// everything BUT the sha (see its own comment); asserting pin-equals-HEAD is not this script's job any
// more, because nothing could ever have satisfied it.
//
// #558, PART 2: `--check` RUNS AT RELEASE TIME, AND NOTHING EQUIVALENT RAN AT DISPATCH TIME -- which is
// the gap that actually needed a fix, not the unsatisfiable comparison above. Three of five live
// dispatches on 2026-09-08 were RED purely because the pin was stale -- one against `main` before #492
// merged, and (the clearest case) one against a branch that had forked before its OWN fix was regenerated
// in, producing the IDENTICAL sha and the IDENTICAL error as the run before it. A stale pin makes a
// dispatch fail on whatever defect the OLD sha happened to carry, which reads exactly like a new bug and
// cost a round trip each time.
//
// So the generated workflow now carries its own `check-pin` job, gating `a11y` via `needs:`, that
// compares the pinned sha against `${{ github.sha }}` -- THE COMMIT THIS RUN IS ACTUALLY EXECUTING AT,
// not a query against `main` specifically. That is deliberate: `github.sha` for a `workflow_dispatch`
// resolves to the tip of whatever ref was dispatched, so the same check is correct whether the dispatch
// is against `main` (the release path) or a feature branch whose pin was just regenerated to its own HEAD
// (the corroboration path used to prove a fix before it merges) -- a literal "must equal main" check would
// refuse the second, legitimate case. `check-pin` runs on `ubuntu-latest`, before `a11y`'s `windows-2022`
// spin-up, so a stale pin now fails in seconds rather than burning a real capture run to say so. This is
// the question `--check`'s removed comparison was reaching for and could never answer at rest: whether
// the pin was regenerated for the commit actually running is only answerable AT dispatch, not in storage.

 * #558: a stale pin is diagnosed HERE, on ubuntu-latest, before the windows-2022 job it gates ever
 * starts -- three of five real dispatches on 2026-09-08 were red purely because the pin had not been
 * regenerated for the commit actually running, and each cost a full Windows spin-up to say so.
 *
 * NOT EXACT EQUALITY AGAINST `github.sha` -- THAT HAS THE IDENTICAL UNSATISFIABLE SHAPE `--check`'s OLD
 * sha comparison did (see this file's own top-of-file comment), just moved from commit time to dispatch
 * time. Regenerating at commit `A` bakes a pin of `A`; COMMITTING that regeneration creates commit `B`
 * (parent `A`) that CONTAINS the pin of `A` -- so the commit a dispatch actually runs at (`github.sha`)
 * is `B`, never `A`, for the identical structural reason a committed file can never equal its own HEAD.
 * Exact equality here would refuse every dispatch, forever, which is worse than the gap it replaces.
 *
 * SO: is the pin an ANCESTOR of `github.sha`, AND has nothing that would CHANGE the generated content
 * (README.md, this generator) landed since the pin -- rather than "is it identical". That is
 * satisfiable by the normal regenerate-then-commit-then-dispatch sequence (the pin is the immediate
 * parent, an ancestor by definition, and nothing else has landed yet), tolerates ordinary commits
 * landing on OTHER files between regeneration and dispatch, and still refuses the real defect class:
 * a pin left behind while README.md or the generator itself moved on. Two separate refusals, because
 * "not in this history at all" and "in this history but stale relative to a real change" need opposite
 * fixes and must not print the same word.
 *
 * `github.sha`, NOT A QUERY AGAINST `main`. `github.sha` for `workflow_dispatch` is the tip of whatever
 * ref was dispatched; under `workflow_call` (release.yml) it is the caller's own sha. Both are exactly
 * "the commit this pin should have been regenerated against" -- comparing against `main` specifically
 * would refuse a legitimate pre-merge dispatch against a feature branch whose pin was freshly
 * regenerated to ITS OWN head (used to corroborate a fix before it merges), since that commit is real
 * and correct but is not, and should not need to be, on `main`.
 *
 * THIS JOB CHECKS OUT a11y-witness ITSELF -- unlike the extracted `a11y` job below, which deliberately
 * does not (the whole point of a consumer-shaped gate). `check-pin` is generator-added infrastructure,
 * never something a reader copies from README.md, so rule #1 (nothing added the document doesn't give)
 * does not apply to it -- the same reasoning that already justifies `needs: [check-pin]` on the
 * extracted job and `verify-report` existing at all. `fetch-depth: 0` because the ancestor/diff checks
