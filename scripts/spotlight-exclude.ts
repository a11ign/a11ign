// @ts-check
// command: stop Spotlight indexing every git worktree on this machine
//
// `mds_stores` was the top CPU consumer on this host for most of 2026-09-09 -- 70-94%, for hours, with
// zero git processes running -- and `syspolicyd`, `trustd` and `diagnosticd` filled the rest of the top
// five. That is Spotlight indexing and Gatekeeper scanning 119 worktrees, each one a full copy of the
// source tree. `queue:table`'s section 5 reported it as contention with no cause until the consumers were
// named; naming them is what turned "the host is slow" into a thing with a remedy.
//
// THE PRUNE IS THE FIRST HALF AND THIS IS THE SECOND. Removing a merged worktree removes what Spotlight
// walks; this stops it walking the ones that must stay -- 54 dirty and 9 cherry-picked at the time of
// writing, none of them removable, all of them indexed.
//
// MEASURED, AND IT DOES NOT WORK: this comment claimed `.metadata_never_index` is "a per-directory
// opt-out". Placed on all 68 worktrees at 12:47Z and verified present; `mds_stores` was 54.8% at 12:45Z
// and 80% at 12:52Z. No effect. On current macOS the marker is honoured at a VOLUME ROOT only, and
// per-directory exclusion is the Spotlight Privacy list -- a machine-owner action, not something this
// repository can perform on somebody's Mac.
//
// THIS SCRIPT IS KEPT ANYWAY, and only for what it actually does: it enumerates every worktree and
// reports which carry the marker. That is the list somebody needs to hand to the Privacy list, and it
// costs nothing. A future macOS may honour the file. What it must not do is be cited as the reason
// indexing fell -- the number that would show that has been measured twice and did not move.
//
// `mdutil -i off` acts on a whole volume and remains the chairman's machine to decide about. Reversible with `rm`, and this script reports what it
// would do unless told to act -- #669's lesson, in the file written the same day: a command whose name
// reads as a report is one somebody runs to look.
