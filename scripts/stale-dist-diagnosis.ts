// command: augment a resolution failure naming a missing export or module with a stale-dist diagnosis
//
// TWO REAL INCIDENTS, ONE AFTERNOON, BOTH MISDIAGNOSED. `SyntaxError: The requested module
// '@a11ign/evidence/conformance' does not provide an export named 'activationBudgetFromDiagnostics'`
// reads as "somebody removed the export". `error TS2307: Cannot find module
// '@a11ign/evidence/document-identity'` reads as "that module does not exist". Both exports existed, in
// the source, on `main` -- the `dist` being resolved simply predated the source it was built from, which
// is exactly the shape #751 made rarer (a fast-forward now rebuilds) and did not make impossible.
//
// NOT AN AUTO-REBUILD. Silently changing the tree in response to a failing command is the shape this
// repository has paid for more than once -- "the remedy fired and nothing recorded it". This only
// DIAGNOSES: it reads two mtimes and appends a line, never touches a file.
//
// NOT A CHECK ON EVERY IMPORT. This runs once, reactively, against the text of a failure that already
// happened -- the cost belongs at the point of failure, never on the happy path.
