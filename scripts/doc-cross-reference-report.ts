// command: print the nightly doc cross-reference report -- every doc-to-doc and doc-to-tree check, as markdown
//
// #905: FOURTEEN checks that ask whether one document still agrees with another, or with the tree, used to run
// only as pull-request tests -- so a doc could drift out from under them between PRs and nobody heard until the
// next unrelated PR went red for it. Each check now lives ONCE, in `scripts/doc-checks/<name>.mjs`: the test
// that used to hold it asserts on that module, and this report runs the same module. There is no second copy
// to drift from the first.
//
// A REPORT, NOT A GATE. It always exits 0, whatever it finds: the nightly workflow (#948) posts what this
// prints, and a doc disagreement is information for a person, never a reason for a job to go red. It never
// calls `gh` either -- posting is the workflow's job.
//
// IT NEVER SAYS "NO PROBLEMS". A check that examined nothing is printed as "examined 0", and a check that could
// not run at all (no git remote, no network) is named with the reason -- a report that read nothing and
// reported clean is the exact failure this repo keeps paying for.
