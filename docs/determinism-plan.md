# The determinism plan

**Thesis: a capture is a sequence of probes over a page that the probes themselves mutate, and every rule
reads the result as if it were one snapshot of one state. That is the defect behind four withdrawn rules in
a single day, and it is the reason fixing one rule keeps breaking another.**

This plan is not "make the tool better". It is one property, stated so it can be falsified:

> **Given the same page, the tool produces the same evidence — and the order the probes run in does not
> change it.**

Everything below exists to make that true and to keep it true.

---

## Why this plan exists

2026-08-28. Four attempts at one criterion (2.1.2's cycling trap), all withdrawn the same day:

| attempt | refuted by |
|---|---|
| ring vs swept form fields | 7 false positives on 86 conformant real pages |
| ring vs rendered tab stops | 9 false positives on the same pages |
| press Escape and re-walk | `anchorToTop` already presses Escape; the probe could not observe a release |
| ring vs actionable roles | **passed** — but only after `rules:gate` caught it failing 2.1.1 |

Every one of them compared two measurements taken in **different states of the page**:

| failure | state A | state B |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1.2 ×3 | the sweep walked the page BEHIND a consent banner | Tab was held INSIDE it |
| 2.1.1 | swept 4 fields behind a dialog | 4 tab stops inside it — **disjoint sets, matching counts** |
| Escape probe | `anchorToTop` pressed Escape and closed the dialog | ...then measured the ring that no longer existed |
| `nls.uk/join/` | one run: 7 distinct of 7 tabbable, silent | another run, same commit: **accused** |

That last row is the whole plan in one line. **Same page, same code, two answers.** It was written off at the
time as "a capture is not an instant" — this repo's own phrase, treated as a fact of life. It is not a fact
of life. It is the tool being non-deterministic, and it is ours, not the web's.

### And our own source already says so

`packages/nvda-worker/src/capture-core.mjs`:

```
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING from here down. `probeFocusOrder` re-anchors and leaves the cursor in focus mode,
// and the Elements List opens a modal dialog leaving the caret somewhere arbitrary — so everything
// position-dependent has already run, and these two cannot swap.
```

*Continuous Delivery*, "State in Acceptance Tests":

> A key aspect of testing is to **establish a known-good starting point**… The ideal test should be
> **atomic**. Having atomic tests means that **the order in which they execute does not matter, eliminating
> a major cause of hard-to-track bugs**.

We wrote down the exact condition the literature calls a major cause of hard-to-track bugs, and preserved it
as a constraint instead of removing it as a defect.

### Why fixing one thing breaks another

*Fundamentals of Software Architecture*:

> We call an architecture "brittle" when a single implementation change can cause unexpected rippling side
> effects that break many other (ostensibly unrelated) things… **the broader the scope, the looser the
> coupling should be**.

Several rules hand-roll the same broad-scope comparison — a count from quick-nav against a count from Tab —
with no explicit contract between them. Measured this session: a guard added to 2.1.1 **subsumed the rule it
was guarding** (it asserted 2.1.1's own premise), and a denominator changed for 2.1.2 moved a rule nobody was
editing. That is textbook brittleness, and D4 is the remedy.

### Why we circle instead of converging

*Specification by Example* records a team with our exact problem — slow test data caused timeouts, so they
fixed the database, which revealed tests starting before data was ready, so they added readiness messages,
which revealed cookie expiry, so they introduced business time:

> Find the most annoying thing and fix it, then something else will pop up… Eventually, if you keep doing
> this, you will create a stable system that will be really useful.

So the iteration is right. But every round of theirs **eliminated a source of entropy**. Every round of ours
**added a guard around one**: a floor, then a wider denominator, then a probe, then a role test — four
rounds routing around a state problem none of them addressed.

**That is the difference this plan is trying to make.**

---

## D1 — A page that can express the fault

**Status: MET 2026-08-28.** Two conformant overlay pages: `image-missing-alt-behind-consent` (a consent
banner over an unlabelled image) and `keyboard-trap-modal-cycle` (a dialog whose two variants differ ONLY
by a Close button in the ring). `check-signals` reports both discriminating, 0 blind, 0 contaminated.

The reproduce-the-fault condition was met in a stronger form than written. Rather than temporarily
restoring the withdrawn tab-stop rule, the new page was captured against the LIVE rules — and produced a
**real 2.1.1 false positive** that had been latent in the corpus the whole time (disjoint channels with
matching counts, which is why counting never saw it). The page proved it can express the fault against a
rule that ships, and the fault it exposed was then fixed.

The corpus is hermetic and single-state. Measured: exactly **one** page carries `role="dialog"` (added
2026-08-28), and **zero** conformant pages carry a consent overlay. `gate:stability` — the determinism gate —
watches five canaries (`form-unlabelled/good`, `form-error-silent/bad`, `table-unassociated-headers/bad`,
`disclosure-state-silent/good`, and one more): all corpus pages, all single-state, all localhost, none with
an overlay.

So the gate that exists to prove the tool is deterministic **cannot observe the non-determinism that has cost
four withdrawals**. That violates this repo's own rule, learned three times in one day: *a canary that cannot
express the fault is worthless.*

Add conformant corpus pages carrying an overlay that confines focus — a consent banner is the honest shape,
since six of the nine real-page false positives were one. The page must be CONFORMANT: the overlay is
dismissible, so nothing about it is a WCAG failure, and any finding on it is the tool's error.

**Done when:**

- At least two conformant corpus pages carry a focus-confining overlay, one of them dismissible only by a
  button in the ring.
- `npm run training:check-signals` reports them discriminating, 0 blind, 0 contaminated.
- Reproduce the fault before trusting the page: with the 2026-08-28 tab-stop rule temporarily restored, the
  new page must be ACCUSED. A page that does not fire the withdrawn rule cannot police its successor.

---

## D2 — The probe-order invariance gate

**Status: MET 2026-08-28.** `npm run gate:probe-order` compares by CONTENT across two probe orders and
reports INCONCLUSIVE — never PASS — for a page it could not capture both ways.

**And it did fail when written, which is the condition that mattered.** Not on the corpus, where it passes
3/3 after D3; on live sites, where it found the `nls.uk` ordering effect that became D7. A gate that had
gone green on first run would have been evidence that it could not see anything.

The property: **capture the same page twice with the probes in different orders, and the evidence must be
identical.** Nothing today asserts this. `capture-core.mjs` declares the opposite in a comment.

This is the gate `gate:stability` should have been. That one repeats the same page in the same order and so
can only catch timing flakiness; it cannot catch a probe changing the page for the next probe, which is the
failure that actually bites.

**Do not fix anything before this fails.** CLAUDE.md's own order — *"write the check that would detect the
problem, run it to confirm the problem is what you think, then fix, then re-run"* — was violated four times
this session, at a cost of two reverts and most of a day.

**Done when:**

- `npm run gate:probe-order` exists, captures each page in ≥2 probe orders, and compares evidence by CONTENT
  (not counts — counts are what hid the disjoint-channel defect: 4 against 4).
- Run against D1's overlay page **it FAILS**, and the diff names which field differs and under which order.
- It is exempt from nothing: a page it cannot capture in both orders is reported as INCONCLUSIVE, never as a
  pass.

---

## D3 — A known starting state for every probe

**Status: MET 2026-08-28.** `establishBrowseMode` runs between probes; `probeSequence` makes the order an
option; `markPageState` stamps the state each probe observed. `gate:probe-order` PASSES 3/3 on the corpus,
`evidence:check` on the lab reports **48/48 same** — so this shipped without a recapture — and the
`ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING` constraint is deleted, surviving only as a historical note explaining the option.

**One correction worth keeping.** `Control+Home` was the obvious anchor and it made the gate WORSE: it
puts the caret ON the `h1`, and quick navigation can never reach the element the caret occupies — so the
`h1` was lost on all three pages. The anchor is `Control+End`, which is the position the read-through
already leaves. A known starting point must be the one the pipeline establishes, not the one that sounds
principled. This generalised a note the repo had recorded as a landmark-only quirk.

*Continuous Delivery* again: establish a known-good starting point; make the steps atomic so order does not
matter. Today the only thing resembling this is `anchorToTop`, which is partial (browse mode and caret only)
and which **mutates state itself** — its first action is `nvda.press("Escape")`, which is why the Escape
probe of attempt 3 was inert: any dialog that responds to Escape was already closed before the ring was
measured.

Each probe must begin from a defined state and must record the state it observed, so "did these two channels
see the same page?" is CHECKABLE rather than inferred. The `focusConfinement` diagnostic added 2026-08-28 is
a hand-rolled instance of exactly this question, asked once.

Note the honest tension: an overlay that a real user must dismiss is part of the page. The answer is not to
pretend it is absent — it is to make the state **explicit and recorded**, so a rule can decline to compare
across a change instead of comparing blindly.

**Done when:**

- `npm run gate:probe-order` PASSES on D1's pages and on ≥3 real pages including `tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/`.
- Every probe emits the state it measured under; a capture where two probes disagree about the state is
  reported, not silently averaged.
- `npm run evidence:check` says whether the corpus moved. If it did, that is a deliberate recapture, budgeted
  once, not discovered afterwards.
- The `ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING` comment is **deleted**, because it is no longer true — and if it is still true,
  this item is not done.

## D4 — One owner for the cross-channel question

**Status: MET 2026-08-28.** `channelRelation` in `rules.ts` is the single owner; a discovery test forbids a
second spelling. Authoritative `rules:gate`: **PASS, all 14 of 14 from rule-ownership.json, 2484 records,
0 false positives**, with 2.1.1 8/8 and 2.1.2 10/10.

**The refactor introduced a regression and the corpus caught it**, which is the point of having one. The
shared function counted `comparableNames(formFields)` — and that helper drops empty names, which IS the
4.1.2 defect. `rules:gate` reported `rule-decided on 10 record(s) and caught only 9`. Count raw, compare
by name.

`addKeyboardTrap`, `addKeyboardUnreachableControl`, `addBrokenFocusOrder` and `cycleCoversThePage` all
hand-roll comparisons between the sweep and the tab walk. There is no single place that owns *"do these two
channels describe the same page, and to what extent do they overlap?"*

Measured cost, 2026-08-28: a guard added to 2.1.1 asserted 2.1.1's own premise and silenced every genuine
finding — caught only because a unit test existed for exactly that. The two criteria read the same comparison
in **opposite directions**, and nothing in the code said so.

**Done when:**

- One exported function answers the same-state/overlap question, and `rules.ts` contains no second spelling
  of it. A discovery test enforces this, the way `rule-oracles.test.ts` does for `oracleCounts`.
- `npm run rules:gate` on the authoritative corpus: PASS, 0 false positives, and 2.1.1 / 2.1.2 / 2.4.3 all
  unchanged from their pre-refactor catch rates.
- Mutation-checked: breaking the shared function must fail tests for MORE THAN ONE criterion. If it fails
  only one, the others are still hand-rolling it.

## D5 — Make `gate:stability` able to see what it is for

**Status: MET 2026-08-28.** Eight canaries, each naming its mechanism in the existing style: the two-state
overlay page from D1, and `nls.uk/join/` — the first REAL page this gate has ever watched. **8/8 STABLE,
5/5 repeats each.**

A load-time guard requires every canary to name exactly one of `path`/`url`, because the first attempt at
the real-page canary silently passed `url: undefined` and reported `=== undefined (5x) === STABLE` — a
canary comparing nothing to nothing, which is this plan's own subject arriving in the fix for it.

Its five canaries are static local corpus pages. It has never watched a real page or an overlay. Its own
header says every canary is present "because of a specific mechanism it can exercise" — the mechanism that
has actually cost this project four rules is not among them.

**Done when:**

- The canary list includes D1's overlay page and at least one real page.
- Each new canary records the mechanism it exercises, in the existing style.
- Reproduce the fault first: each must be shown to FAIL under the defect it is meant to catch.

---

## D6 — A verdict cannot be built without saying what it examined

**Status: MET 2026-08-28. All done-conditions, including the unserved-page refusal.**

`gateVerdict` in `packages/lab/src/gates/verdict.ts` derives the verdict from coverage, so a PASS with
`examined < of` is unconstructible. Five gates migrated; `verdict-adoption.test.ts` discovers every gate
script and fails in BOTH directions — an unmigrated gate must be exempt, and a migrated one must NOT be.
It caught a stale exemption on three of the five migrations, including one made minutes after committing
a message about that exact habit.

**Two gates were nearly identical and needed opposite answers, which is the result worth keeping.**
`score-rules` ranks a proven defect above a stale corpus — the same ordering as `gateVerdict` — so it
migrated, and now reports `14 of 14 from rule-ownership.json` where it used to report a bare record count.
`evidence-check` ranks incomplete coverage ABOVE a detected change, deliberately, because its sample is
stratified one case per family. It is recorded as `deliberate`, not `owed`, with a reason long enough to
argue with. Adding a flag to `gateVerdict` to serve both would have been the conflation this item exists
to remove, wearing a shared function's clothes.

It is easy because **a result crosses a boundary as a bare verdict and its SCOPE does not travel with it.**
Every instance in one session:

| where | the verdict | what it left behind |
|---|---|---|
| pre-push hook | `ok check-signals` | "226 of 1461 examined" |
| `worker:code` | "nothing to compare" | "…of the LOCAL pool; inventory.yml has 5, all stale" |
| capture preflight | "Fleet runs this checkout" | "0 worker(s) checked" |
| `rules:gate` | `2.1.2:focus-trapped 12/12 EXACT` | which 12 records, and that the new case was not among them |
| `gate:probe-order` (mine, before it shipped) | would have said `PASS` | that it never reached a real page — Edge serves its own error page, so both orders compare identical |

**This is NOT a modularity problem, and more packages would make it worse**: every package boundary is one
more place for scope to be dropped. The package boundaries here already work, and they work because they are
enforced by DISCOVERY TESTS rather than convention — adding one file tripped six of them (budget ladder,
flag guard, entry-point guard, git-tracking, the `GUARDED` registry with a required reason, and CLAUDE.md's
own count of guarded CLIs). Each caught a real defect and named the incident behind it.

**Nor is printing the number sufficient.** Surveyed across the gate scripts:

```
score-rules.ts       population-in-verdict: 6
evidence-check.mjs   population-in-verdict: 4     <- and it STILL passed on 2 of 48
stability-gate.mjs   population-in-verdict: 0
```

`evidence-check` printed its coverage and passed anyway, because the guard tested `compared === 0` rather
than `compared < expected` — the extreme case, not the middle. So the rule is: **the verdict must be a
function of coverage, not merely accompanied by it.**

**Done when:**

- One shared result shape — `{ verdict, examined, of, source }` — that a gate cannot construct without
  stating its population and where that population came from.
- The verdict is DERIVED from coverage: a gate that examined fewer than it expected reports INCONCLUSIVE,
  and cannot report PASS. `evidence-check`'s 2-of-48 must be inexpressible, not merely caught.
- A discovery test finds every gate script and requires it to return that shape or be exempt with a reason,
  the way `cli-flags.test.ts` does for argv readers. A list would rot; this is the mechanism that does not.
- Mutation-checked on the five rows above: each must become impossible to state, not merely unlikely.
- **A capture must refuse a page nothing is serving. DONE 2026-08-28**, proved on bare-metal
  `a11y-worker-6` rather than argued:

  ```
  landedOnRequested  ok: true   actual: "http://127.0.0.1:59999/nothing"   <- the URL guard PASSED
  pageServed         status: 0                                            <- the new guard refused
  fault: "page-unreachable"                                       HTTP 500, in 532 ms
  ```

  The URL guard passing in the same response is the whole point: the address WAS the one requested, and
  the page behind it was missing. On a served page the same mark reads `status: 200` and the capture
  proceeds, so "checked and clean" and "never ran" cannot leave the same silence.

  **A guard for this already existed and structurally could not see it.** `BROWSER_ERROR_TITLE_RE` matches
  Chromium's error PHRASES, but Chromium titles a network-error page with the HOST — so an unserved
  `http://<worker-host>:3000/x` is titled `<worker-host>` and matched nothing. A title is a proxy for the
  status; the status is the status. Both are kept.

  Audited for false refusals before shipping: **89 of 89 real corpus sites return 200**, so it refuses
  nothing that should capture. Positive control `capture:check` ALL PASSED on the fleet.

  The count reached FOUR before it was fixed — `stability-gate` was the fourth, caught while migrating it
  to the verdict shape. Added after the same trap caught me THREE TIMES in
  one session — in `gate:probe-order` before it shipped, in a diagnostic script twenty minutes after fixing
  it there, and in a third script two hours after writing the commit message about it. Edge serves its own
  error page on a dead port, so two orders compare IDENTICAL and a gate reports PASS; an ad-hoc capture
  returns `focusOrder: ["<worker-host>, document, read only"]` and reads as a valid capture of a document.
  The tool already refuses a page whose URL is not the one requested (`landedVerdict`), and that check does
  not fire here: the URL IS right, it is the page behind it that is missing.

  **This cannot be a discipline, and the evidence is that the person who had just fixed it could not hold
  it.** The guarded path is always the ceremonial one — a five-line diagnostic skips the lease because
  leasing feels like overhead for one question, and a diagnostic is exactly when you are moving fast and
  least inclined to doubt the answer. The fix is structural: the worker reports the navigation's HTTP
  status from the DevTools Protocol, and a non-2xx is a refused capture rather than evidence. Then every
  ad-hoc script gets the property for free, which is the only way it survives a hurry.

---

## D7 — The PAGE's state, not the screen reader's

**Status: MET 2026-08-28. All four done-conditions.**

`markPageState` records a DOM fingerprint per probe rather than once per capture, and `gate:probe-order`
reports `PAGE-MOVED` separately from `CHANGED` — so a ticking clock on `tfl.gov.uk` no longer reads as an
ordering fault. `PAGE-MOVED` reduces coverage rather than counting as examined, so such a run is
INCONCLUSIVE and cannot pass.

`probeStates` joins `oracleCounts` — the single extraction step every rule caller already takes — so the
fingerprint reaches the rules as `ruleEvidence`, a sibling of `input`. It had been sitting in `diagnostics`,
which is on the exporter's `FORBIDDEN_INPUT_KEYS`: exactly where the AX census sat while
`1.3.1:no-headings` read `NEVER FIRED ANYWHERE`.

**Why the inference was not enough, which is the point of the item.** `channelRelation.disjoint` reasons
that two channels sharing no control names probably saw different pages. It cannot tell *the page moved*
from *the sweep found nothing*, and it is silent whenever the two overlap a LITTLE — which is `nls.uk/join/`
exactly: the ring falls from 150 stops to 10 and the handful of names that still match leave `disjoint`
false, so an absence claim was available on a comparison of two different pages.

Authoritative `rules:gate`: **PASS, all 14 of 14, 1242 conformant records, 0 false positives.** Three
answers stay apart — `false` the shape changed, `true` it held, `undefined` nobody asked — and the rule
tests `=== false`, so every capture predating this keeps its behaviour. `disjoint` is KEPT for that reason
and is not redundant: the entire existing corpus reaches the rule with no fingerprint at all.

`gate:probe-order` still reports `nls.uk` as `PAGE-MOVED`, and that is now the CORRECT answer rather than a
residual: the page really does move, the gate says which, and the rules decline to compare across it.

D3 restores what the SCREEN READER carries between probes — browse mode and caret position — and
`gate:probe-order` passes on all three corpus pages because of it. Pointed at live sites, it found the half
D3 does not touch:

```
nls.uk/join/    interaction.focusOrder: 10 -> 150
  default      "close search, button, expanded", "search the site, tab, selected"    10 stops
  focus-first  "skip to main content, link", "open menu, button, collapsed"          150 — the cap
```

Under `default` the sweep runs first, its disclosure probe ACTIVATES a control, and the search panel opens —
so the focus walk is confined to 10 stops inside it. Under `focus-first` nothing has touched the page and
the walk covers the whole site. **The sweep changed the page for the next probe**, and no amount of
restoring NVDA's state undoes a click.

CLAUDE.md already records this, as an anecdote explaining one false positive: *"sportengland's search panel
was expanded for the sweep and collapsed for the focus probe… A capture is not an instant."* It has now been
MEASURED as an ordering effect, on a different site, by a gate — which is the difference between a story and
a check.

**The fix is not to stop clicking.** The disclosure probe is how 4.1.3 and half of 3.3.1 are reachable at
all. It is to make the change VISIBLE, which is D3's own second half, written into that item and not built:
*"Every probe stamps the state it observed, so 'did these two channels see the same page?' is checkable
rather than inferred."* Today `domCensus` is sampled ONCE, before every probe, so nothing can see the page
move underneath.

**Done when:**

- A cheap page-state fingerprint is recorded PER PROBE, not once per capture.
- `gate:probe-order` distinguishes "the evidence differs because the probes ran in a different order" from
  "the evidence differs because the page changed" — and reports which, rather than failing for both.
- The rules can decline to compare two channels that observed different fingerprints. That is the same fact
  `channelRelation.disjoint` infers from overlap, available directly instead of guessed at.
- Read for on a live page: `tfl.gov.uk` differed by `"now at 17:30" -> "now at 17:34"` and a link's
  `visited` state. A ticking clock is the PAGE changing and must never read as an ordering fault.

---

## What the plan did not anticipate, found by running it

Three things surfaced only once the gates ran on the real fleet rather than on one laptop VM. None is a
plan item; all three were costing evidence the whole time.

### The transport was dropping a fifth of all responses, and the work was never lost

`gate:stability` kept turning INCONCLUSIVE on `FAILED read ETIMEDOUT` — three different canaries, three
different boxes, so neither the page nor the machine. **The asymmetry is the diagnosis:**

| | measured, 2026-08-28 |
|---|---|
| the WORKERS, across 242 captures | 1 failure (a deliberate dead-port test), 0 recoveries |
| the CLIENT, in one gate run | **9 lost responses in 40 captures** |
| 12 consecutive SHORT requests | 3-11 ms, none lost |

The work completed every time; only the answer was lost. The worker writes status and body together at the
END of a capture, so the socket carries **zero bytes for 12-520 s** — an idle connection to every NAT,
firewall and Wi-Fi power-save in the path, and this host reaches the fleet over Wi-Fi. It presented as
`read ETIMEDOUT`, the OS syscall, never as our own deadline (which says "timed out after N ms").

Two fixes, and the second is the one that removes the fault rather than surviving it:

```
recovery only (captureId)        9 sockets recovered / 40 captures   PASS 8/8
recovery + TCP keepalive 15 s    0 sockets recovered                 PASS 8/8
```

**Confirmed by PREDICTION, not by a green result.** The 8/8 arrived one run before the keepalive did, and
was deliberately not credited: nothing in the output could then say whether the recovery had fired or the
network had simply been quiet. Printing the count — always, including the zero — is what made the next
result mean something.

Note `worker-http.mjs` is control-plane, not a worker file, so this needed no `fleet:deploy`.

### Ten capture clients POSTed to `/capture` and ONE survived a lost socket

The `captureId` store has returned a completed capture verbatim for months. Nine clients never asked. That
is the remedy-at-one-call-site shape at its largest here, and it only became visible on bare metal: on
three VMs sharing one Mac the socket was a virtual bridge and effectively lossless.

### The gates ran on ONE box while four idled

Every gate took a single `--worker`. `gate:stability` did 40 captures on one machine; `gate:probe-order`
refused to start without one. Both now **shard**: 8 canaries over 5 boxes is 2 deep instead of 8, and 5
pages over 5 boxes is 1 deep instead of 5.

The shard boundary is the load-bearing part. A page's REPEATS stay on one box, and both ORDERS of a page
stay on one box — splitting either would make a difference between runs, or between orders,
indistinguishable from a difference between machines, which is the conflation these gates exist to detect
arriving through the scheduler instead of through the probes.

### An OPEN TENSION, recorded rather than resolved by redefinition

D3's done-condition says `gate:probe-order` should PASS on `tfl.gov.uk`. It cannot, and the reason is D7,
which was written later: tfl carries a clock (`now at 22:43` -> `22:47`) and live disruption banners, so
the page moves under its own probes on every run and the ordering question is unanswerable there. The gate
correctly reports PAGE-MOVED and reduces coverage — which means **with a live page in the list this gate is
permanently INCONCLUSIVE.**

That is honest and it is also a problem: a gate that can never pass is a gate people stop reading. The
options are to gate on the corpus pages and report live pages as evidence, or to accept a standing
INCONCLUSIVE. It is a product decision about what the gate promises, so it is written down rather than
made silently — the same reasoning as the abstention threshold in `docs/adr/`.

---

## Not in this plan, and why

- **Replacing guidepup with our own NVDA layer.** Considered and rejected on evidence. Every capture in the
  four withdrawals was ACCURATE — tfl's ring really was those five controls, the corpus trap's really was
  three text inputs, and the lab's capture was byte-identical to a laptop's. guidepup reported the truth every
  time and we drew the wrong conclusion from it. Where it HAS cost us (U+FFFC, the half-open speech socket,
  `capture: "initial"`) all three are fixed. This would be months of work aimed at the one component that has
  been telling the truth, and it would not have prevented a single withdrawal.
- **A database for the corpus.** ~2,500 immutable content-addressed JSON documents, written once, read by
  scanning: a filesystem workload. It would add a daemon beside the corpus, the release weights and the deploy
  key — the surface ADR 0012 keeps clear — and answer no question `lab:inventory` cannot. Revisit when there
  is a query it cannot answer.
- **"Zero defects" as a slogan.** Kept as the target, dropped as a claim. Each item here names the check that
  would catch its defect; that is what turns the goal into a work list instead of an assertion. What is NOT
  reachable is "the live web never changes" — and that was never a defect in the tool. The other three senses
  (same evidence → same findings; same state → same evidence; same URL → same evidence) are all reachable and
  this plan is how.

---

## How to know the plan worked

One number, on the thing that has been wrong all along:

```bash
npm run gate:probe-order        # PASSES on overlay pages and on real pages
npm run rules:gate              # PASS, 0 false positives on the authoritative corpus
npm run rules:real-pages        # PASS, 0 new findings on 86 conformant pages

And one behaviour: **`nls.uk/join/` gives the same answer twice.**

### MET 2026-08-28, and here is exactly what that is worth

```
=== https://www.nls.uk/join/ (5x) ===
  STABLE — 5 usable, all fields identical
8/8 canaries stable
```

The page that gave two different verdicts at the same commit — silent in one run, ACCUSED in another — now
repeats identically five times, as a `gate:stability` canary rather than as an observation somebody made.

**What five clean runs establish, stated honestly.** Zero failures in five bounds the failure rate at
roughly 45% upper by the rule of three; it does not prove determinism. `identity:rate` already prints that
caveat for its own zero counts and this deserves the same. The defensible claim is "five consecutive
captures of a live page agreed on every compared field", which is exactly the observation the plan was
written to make possible — and not "the tool is deterministic on nls.uk".

**And it is not attributable to one fix.** The original disagreement predates the caret anchoring, the
browse-mode restoration and D4's denominator change, any of which could have addressed it. The value here is
that the question is now ASKED ON EVERY RUN by a gate, so the next disagreement is caught rather than
noticed.

**The gap it does not close:** `gate:probe-order` still reports `nls.uk` as PAGE-MOVED, because the sweep's
disclosure probe opens a search panel before the focus walk sees it. Run-to-run determinism is met;
probe-order independence on that page is not, and D7 records why.
