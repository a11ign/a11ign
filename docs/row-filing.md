# Filing a backlog row: `npm run row-file`

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/backlog-row.yml` marks Region, Acceptance and Open-check `required` — but that is a
GitHub issue **form**, and forms apply only in the web UI. Every row this fleet files goes through
`gh issue create --body`, which bypasses the form entirely: there is no field to leave blank, because there
are no fields.

Measured 2026-09-09 (#735, worker-capture): of 76 open rows, 36 were missing at least one required section
(25 missing Region, 5 missing Acceptance, 28 missing Open-check) — and the rate was **worse** on the
newest rows (82% of `#700+`) than the oldest (22% of `#0–399`), because the more the org files its own
work with `gh issue create`, the more of the backlog becomes un-claimable. `row-claim.mjs` (#707) already
refuses to claim such a row, naming the missing field — but that refusal lands on whoever picks the row up
later, with less context than whoever filed it had.

## Use this instead of `gh issue create` directly

```sh
npm run row-file -- --title "..." --body "## Region\n\n...\n\n## Acceptance\n\n...\n\n## Open-check\n\n..." --session=<your-session-name> [any other gh issue create flag]
# or
npm run row-file -- --title "..." --body-file /path/to/body.md --session=<your-session-name> [any other gh issue create flag]
```

`--session=<name>` is **required** — the same flag `row-claim.mjs` already uses for dispatch/claim/decline,
reused rather than a second, independently-typed one. `packages/agent-org/src/row-file.mjs` reads exactly the body this
invocation would file — from `--body`/`--body=` or `--body-file`/`--body-file=` — and checks it against the
**same rule** `row-claim` already enforces at claim time (`missingTemplateFields`, imported unchanged from
`packages/agent-org/src/row-claim/template-fields-rule.mjs`, #707). If a required section is missing, it refuses and names
which one, before `gh` ever runs.

If the body is complete, it is filed with a `Filed-by: <session>` line appended (#771) — a body line, never
a label, since a `filed-by:*` label would collide with `session:*`'s existing meaning of *claimed* (the
2026-09-09 ruling; see #683 for the identical collision that removing `session:` on close would otherwise
have caused). `row-claim check`/`--row=` prints it: `Filed-by: unrecorded` on any row filed without this
tool, never inferred from prose that happens to say who filed it — GitHub's `author` is one fleet account
for every row, so nothing else can answer this question at all.

Every other flag `gh issue create` accepts (`--label`, `--assignee`, `--milestone`, `--project`, …) passes
straight through unchanged; this tool does not enumerate or restrict them.

## Why this and not a stricter check

The population is not static — every row a session files adds to it, so a one-time sweep's number is stale
before it can be read. The fix is a check that runs at the moment a row is created, not a count pinned into
a row body. `tracker-auditor`'s hourly report separately counts open rows still missing a section, so the
population's current size stays visible without depending on every filer having used this tool.

**This does not relax the claim-time gate**, and should not: an `Open-check` is what stopped three of six
rows seeded on 2026-09-06 being worked after they were already fixed. It also does not weaken to counting
headings rather than content — a `## Open-check` with nothing under it still refuses, because it asserts
exactly what `row-claim` asserts (`hasTemplateField`'s "real content under it", not a bare heading match).

## What makes an Open-check re-checkable by somebody else, later

The claim-time gate asks only that the section has real content under it. These two rules are what make
that content mean anything to whoever re-runs it, and each has now been paid for twice.

**AN OPEN-CHECK NAMES A BEHAVIOUR THAT FLIPS, NEVER A GREP FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION SHAPE.** A grep answers a
question about the TEXT of the code; the row is a claim about what the code DOES. The two come apart in
both directions, which is why the green is not evidence either way: a filer can satisfy a grep with prose
that changes nothing, and a real fix can leave the grepped shape exactly where it was. Ruled 2026-09-22 on
a row whose own open-check grepped a branch listing for a row number — the listing names no row at all, so
the check would have read a deliberately-kept control branch as an offender and cost it. **The same defect
then landed one level down, inside that row's own PR, in a test.** An assertion written to hold a
pool-free contract matched a `gh` argv containing `--jq`, and the call it had to catch carries `--json`:
**it passed while the call went out.** The shape-free form is the repair, and it catches every `gh` rather
than every `gh` somebody remembered to spell:

```js
assert.deepEqual(calls.filter((c) => c[0] === "gh"), []);
```

So state the check as the sentence that is FALSE today and TRUE once the row lands, run it before filing,
and record which way it read. This is not only about row bodies: **any green read off a shape is a
statement about the shape**, and reporting it as a statement about behaviour is the same error wherever it
happens.

**A MEASUREMENT TAKEN AGAINST LIVE `origin` HAS A SHELF LIFE, AND A BODY THAT DOES NOT NAME THE REF IT
DEPENDED ON CANNOT BE RE-CHECKED.** Branches merge and are deleted; the command in the body keeps running
and keeps answering, and its answer changes without the row saying anything. A demonstration published in
a PR body was measured against a branch that merged and was deleted from origin days later, so the
published command now correctly returns `null` — and reads as the defect being fixed. **The failure mode is
not that the number went stale. It is that the re-checker cannot tell WHICH THING MOVED** — the code under
test, or the fixture the command pointed at. Both produce the same output, and one means *this was fixed*
while the other means *this was never true*. A reading with no named ref is not a weaker measurement; it
is an unfalsifiable one.

The buildable half: **a reading against live `origin` names the ref it used and states whether that ref is
expected to survive.** Where a durable ref exists — a merge commit, a tag, a SHA — prefer it to a branch
name, which is a moving pointer that may simply stop existing. Where none does, say so in the body, so a
later re-check reads *the fixture is gone* rather than *the fix regressed*. One command settles whether a
branch still exists on origin, and it is worth running while the row is being written rather than when it
is being re-checked:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin '<the branch the reading used>'   # no output: the ref is already gone
```

**Neither rule is a new claim-time gate**, and neither should become one. Whether a check names a
behaviour is not machine-decidable, which is exactly why `missingTemplateFields` asks only that the
section has content under it. These are written rules because the thing they are about is a judgement.

## Writing a section that has no content: say so, never leave it blank

Two rules from the 2026-09-09 backfill, in the guidance rather than in the heads of whoever did it.

**A section that is genuinely empty gets a sentence, not a blank.** A row that changes no file writes
`Region: none — this row changes no file, because …`, and a row with nothing to invert says so under
Mutation. *"This row touches nothing"* and *"nobody wrote the section down"* are different states and no
audit can tell them apart, so a blank leaves the row in the missing-section count forever and reads as an
oversight. #149 (a parent that deletes nothing), #72 (a change only an npm org owner can make) and #668
(a count each session accounts for) are the worked examples.

**A PROBE IS A READ. A WRITE IS NEVER A PROBE.** To find out whether the API will accept a write, ask with
`gh api -i` on a **read** and look at `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` — the headers are on every real call, not
only on mutating ones. `gh api rate_limit` is not an instrument here: measured 2026-09-09 in the same
second, it reported `core 5000/5000` while a real call's headers reported **2,216 already used**, and a
secondary limit does not appear in it at all. Sending a `POST` to find out whether `POST` works created
row #798, titled `probe`, in the live tracker — the same defect as the fixture rule above, committed by
the person who had closed #762 for it two hours earlier.

**AND `git show <ref>:<path>` IS THE READ. `git checkout <ref> -- <path>` IS A WRITE TO THE INDEX.** It
copies the ref's whole tree into the working tree and stages it, so running it to *look at* a file on
`main` staged fifteen files across a `pm/` branch — including `.github/workflows/trunk.yml`, which
that branch may not touch, and other sessions' in-flight work. Nothing was committed; a later
`git checkout` to another branch aborted, which is the only reason it was noticed. CLAUDE.md already
carries `git checkout --` as the command that destroyed release-eligible weights; **this is the same
command reached for as a read.**

**And tracker mutations go out at no more than ten a minute per session, with a pause between batches**;
a batch over twenty is announced in the hourly line before it runs. Twenty-six board additions in four
minutes bought a secondary rate limit that refused every session's writes for the next fifteen — cheap per
item, costed to whoever needed the resource next.

**And an invented section is worse than an absent one.** A plausible-looking Acceptance gets built
against; a blank one is visible. Where the sections are written by somebody other than the filer — the
backfill marked each *"sections written by the PM from the filing, filer to confirm"* — the mark is an
invitation to **replace**, never to append: a second `## Acceptance` beside the first is what #746
measured going red as `DUPLICATE -- 2 sections found`.

## The sections a machine reads: Region and Acceptance

Two rulings from 2026-09-09, both earned the same evening, and both about the same thing: **a section
that is parsed is not prose, whatever it reads like.** A person reads these correctly. The only reader
that matters does not.

**A REGION LISTS ONLY PATHS THE CHANGE TOUCHES. AN EXCLUSION IS PROSE UNDER ITS OWN HEADING, NEVER IN
THE REGION — THERE IS NO NEGATION GRAMMAR.** `declaredRegionFiles` parses that section for paths and
cannot see the word `not`, so this sentence, written inside #848's Region, **declared exactly what it
denied**:

> **`.github/workflows/ready-label-audit.yml` is NOT in this region**

`fileOverlapReason` then refused another session's claim on #849 over a file #848 had no intention of
touching: **the row's own disclaimer was the thing that blocked them.** Put the exclusion under
`## Not in scope`, and say why it is not a preference — *"a `pm/` branch may not touch that
directory"* — which is where a reader looks for it anyway. Measured across all 63 open rows carrying a
Region: **one harmful instance and three latent**, each escaping only by accident of the grammar — a
directory with no filename, a file that was in scope regardless. **The accident is not a defence; the
grammar will change.** The check is one command, and it is the check to run before quoting any row's
region:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import {declaredRegionFiles} from './packages/agent-org/src/region-paths.mjs';
  import {readFileSync} from 'node:fs';
  console.log(declaredRegionFiles(readFileSync(process.argv[1],'utf8')))" <a file holding the row body>
```

If a path you meant to exclude comes back in that list, the row is claiming it.

**AND AN ACCEPTANCE NAMES FILES, NEVER `npm test`.** #854's acceptance said `npm test`, passed
`row-file`, and was then refused by `pr:open`: *"needs `corpus`, which this job does not have —
`abstention-regression.test.ts` requires corpus via `compareAtFloor`"*. The acceptance job has no token
and no corpus and runs commands taken from a PR body, so *"the whole suite"* is not something it can run.
`worker-capture`'s statement of why is the half that makes the rule follow from something rather than
merely assert it: **a row's acceptance is written before anybody knows which job will run it**, which is
exactly why it has to name the files the change is verified by rather than the command a developer would
type. `pr:open`'s own refusal says it best, and a filer who follows it exactly will pass:

> a PR whose author cannot name a file that verifies it has no acceptance

**AND THE FILES IT NAMES COME FROM THE RIGHT POPULATION. A transcript names the files a defect is IN. An
acceptance names the files that must RUN. A population derived for one purpose does not transfer to the
other.** #1160 (2026-09-12) had already been refused once for saying `npm test`; the replacement was
built from the sweep output that found the defect — a list of the files it appeared in — and `pr:open`
refused that too:

> needs `corpus`, which this job does not have — `exit-code-contract.test.ts` requires corpus, at :119

**The second refusal was the same refusal**, and the wrong population was chosen in the very edit that
answered the first. The two lists overlap enough to look interchangeable and they answer different
questions: *where did I find it* has no opinion about what the acceptance job can run, and *what must run*
has no opinion about where the defect was. Derive the second from the first by asking, of each file, **will
this command open it and can this job run it** — and check the answer the way the section is read:

```bash
comm -3 <(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | sort) <(<the acceptance command, one path per line> | sort)
```

Anything in either column is a file the change touches and the acceptance never opens, or a file the
acceptance names and the change never touched. **Both are wrong and they cancel in a count**, which is how
#1160 read as 24-for-24 while naming one file it did not touch and omitting one it did.

**Neither rule is a request to teach the parser more grammar.** Teaching `declaredRegionFiles` to read
negation would make it guess at intent, and the exclusion belongs under its own heading for the human
reader anyway.

## `out-of-release` answers one question, and importance is not it

**`out-of-release` answers ONE question: does this block the 20 September publish. It does not mean
unimportant. A row that is out of release and worth fixing soon is spelled "out of release, ready" —
importance is said by the ready order, not by which milestone a row sits on.**

Earned 2026-09-12 on #1161, a defect in `packages/agent-org/src/row-claim.mjs`'s refusal message. It was moved **into**
the release on an argument from severity, and `worker-capture`'s objection was that the label had been
answering its own question correctly all along: `row-claim.mjs` ships in no package, so it cannot block a
publish however badly it behaves. **`ceo` reversed their own ruling** — no severity axis, because the
tracker already has one and it is the ready order. The row is now *out of release, `ready`*, which says
both things without either contradicting the other.

**The `Out of release` milestone's own description carries this sentence too, and the two are compared by
a guard rather than left to agree.** `ready-label-audit.mjs`'s `guidanceDrift` fails when either copy stops
carrying what the other says — because two copies of one rule with nothing comparing them is the defect
that produced five incidents in one day (`docs/operational-lessons.md`), and writing a rule about drift
twice, unpinned, would be this page refuting itself.

**It detects a rule going MISSING, not a rule changing meaning**, and the distinction is worth knowing
before you edit either copy. It matches phrases, so a faithful rewording of either one reads as *deleted*
and reddens the nightly audit until the two are re-synced — **and the remedy is to re-sync them, never to
loosen the check.** The two saying it the same way is the property. A copy that keeps every phrase and
reverses every meaning passes clean, which no phrase-matching guard can prevent; if you are inverting a
rule rather than editing it, this guard is not the thing that will catch you.
