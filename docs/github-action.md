# The GitHub Action

Drive a real screen reader over a page in CI and report what it announced.

```yaml
name: a11ign

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  a11ign:
    runs-on: windows-2022        # NVDA is Windows-only; the action fails fast and says so otherwise
    timeout-minutes: 20          # a run that will not finish says so here, not after GitHub's own default
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write       # for the PR comment below; omit it and the report still runs, only quieter
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: a11ign/a11ign@v0.1.0
        # Pinned to v0.1.0, the first tagged release. Use the full 40-character commit SHA instead if
        # your CI must not move even across a release -- GitHub refuses an abbreviated one outright, it
        # does not just discourage it.
        id: a11ign
        with:
          url: https://example.com/contact
          task: Send an enquiry
      # Keep the evidence: the rendered report and the full result, transcript included. Guarded on the
      # output existing, so a run that failed does not also fail the upload.
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always() && steps.a11ign.outputs.result-json != ''
        with:
          name: a11ign-result
          path: |
            ${{ steps.a11ign.outputs.result-json }}
            ${{ steps.a11ign.outputs.summary-md }}
          if-no-files-found: warn
```

Save it as `.github/workflows/a11ign.yml`. It runs on every pull request, and `workflow_dispatch` also lets you start it by hand from the repository's Actions tab (or `gh workflow run a11ign.yml`) — `workflow_dispatch` resolves the workflow from the default branch as GitHub sees it at dispatch time, so trigger it only after the push that changed the workflow has landed, not in the same breath as the push.

**`timeout-minutes: 20` bounds a run that will not finish** — a job that hangs or loses its runner leaves
no log and no artifact, and any diagnostic step you add with `if: always()` does not run either; see
[the account of one, and what to do about it](./try-it.md#the-fastest-route-a-github-actions-run) in
`docs/try-it.md`.

No API key. The default judge is this project's **own trained scorer** — 27 KB of heads shipped in the
repo, over an 87 MB encoder fetched at setup — so nothing leaves the runner and nothing is billed.

A longer, commented version of the same workflow is in [`examples/workflow.yml`](../examples/workflow.yml).

## Why it looks like this

**Composite, not Docker.** Container actions do not run on Windows runners, and NVDA needs Windows.

**`fail-on` defaults to `never`.** A tool that breaks builds the day it is installed gets uninstalled. One
that reports first, and fails when the team decides it should, gets adopted. Move to `blocker`, then
`serious`, as you fix what it finds. A severity means *that or worse*. **fail-on counts asserted findings;
referrals are listed and never fail the run.** A referral is a person's decision, so no threshold fires on it.

An **unrecognised** `fail-on` is a hard error rather than a fallback to `never`. A typo in a workflow file
that silently produces a permanently green check is the failure nobody notices, because green is exactly
what they expected.

**No rented judge by default.** `judge-backend: local` uses the scorer trained on this project's own
1,061-pair corpus. It covers a fixed set of criteria, and each run's own summary names how many and which layer decides each; it is silent on everything else, narrower than an LLM.

<!-- CLAIM:BEGIN — every figure between these markers must be sourceable from a recorded gate result in
     docs/board/reported/. `public-claim.test.ts` enforces it across every file in CLAIM_FILES.

     THE FIGURES THIS PAGE USED TO CARRY, kept here rather than published: it said "zero false positives
     across 1,034 conformant records", the README said 1,183, and the guarded claim said 1,405. Only
     1,405 is in a recorded gate. Three documents disagreeing about one measurement is why this sentence
     now states the honest position instead of picking one. -->
**The false-positive rate of the local judge on the conformant corpus is being re-measured**, so this
page does not state one. That is the honest position rather than a placeholder: a figure appears here
only when a recorded gate has printed it.
<!-- CLAIM:END --> `anthropic` and `openai` remain
available for broader, noisier coverage; the action refuses at once if you name one without a key or an
endpoint, rather than discovering it after a 20-minute capture.

The trained weights are committed deliberately, in `@a11ign/scorer`
(`packages/scorer/models/screenreader-scorer/`). Only the 87 MB encoder beside them is gitignored, and an
earlier version of that rule excluded the weights too — so the local judge worked only on the machine that
trained it, and a shipped action would have had **no model at all**.

The rule used to need `models/*` rather than `models/`, because git does not descend into an excluded
directory: a negation under it never fires, the file could only be added with `git add -f`, and a future
retrain would then silently not be committed. That shape is no longer needed for the weights — nothing
excludes an ancestor of `packages/scorer/models/screenreader-scorer` — but the lesson still applies to any
new ignore rule with a negation under it.

**One PR comment, updated.** `gh pr comment --edit-last --create-if-none` plus an HTML marker in the body,
so a busy PR gets one comment that changes rather than one per push. The comment step runs `always()`, so
the report still arrives when the check is failing — which is precisely when someone wants to read it.

**Not on a pull request, no comment.** A run started by hand or by a push has nothing to comment on: the log's last line is the count (`a11ign: N finding(s)`), with a line before it for anything that bounds that count (an examination that ended early, a capture spanning more than one document, criteria resting on an examination known to be partial), and the report is in the `a11ign-result` artifact the upload step saves above — both the rendered report (`summary-md`) and the full result, transcript included (`result-json`).

**The same rendered report is also written to the run's job summary, but a CI-only consumer — no browser,
nothing rendered — cannot reach that.** GitHub exposes Actions job summaries (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`,
which the Report step also writes) through neither the REST nor the GraphQL API. Confirmed directly: `GET
/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/jobs` returns no `summary` field on a job at all, and
GraphQL's `CheckRun.summary` — which reads like the same thing — is a distinct field, populated only by
the separate Checks API's own `output.summary`, and stays `null` for a run whose only summary came from
`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. A marker written to the job summary does not appear anywhere in either API's
response for that run. The only route to the job summary itself is the browser's own "Summary" tab on
the run page — the artifact below is what a CLI-only reader uses instead.

**The artifact is the route that works headlessly — it is an ordinary REST download.** The workflow
above already uploads `a11ign-result` with both files in it, guarded on `result-json` existing so a run
that failed before producing one cannot upload nothing. Fetch it the same way any CI-only consumer
fetches any artifact:

```bash
# gh CLI, which wraps the REST call:
gh run download <run-id> --repo <owner>/<repo> --name a11ign-result --dir .

# the same thing over plain REST, if you are not using gh:
artifact_id=$(gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<run-id>/artifacts" \
  --jq '.artifacts[] | select(.name=="a11ign-result") | .id')
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/artifacts/$artifact_id/zip" > result.zip
```

Either way what comes back is a directory holding both files: `a11ign-summary.md`, the exact rendered
report the job summary carries, readable in a terminal with no further processing; and the file
`result-json` names, the schema below (`verdict.findings`, `verdict.taskCompletable`,
`captureVerified`, ...) — the transcript behind every finding. Neither needs a browser or
`pull-requests: write` permission.

**"Not run" is never rendered as "clean".** If you set `axe: false`, the report says the visual criteria
are *unchecked*, not that they passed. This is the one thing the tool must never get wrong, and it did:
the CLI's `--json` output emitted `ruleBased: []` for a skipped axe run while its text report correctly
emitted `null`, so the Action rendered unchecked contrast as "0 violations". Found by running the whole
thing end to end rather than by a unit test, and fixed at source so both output paths read one value.

## The setup steps are not boilerplate

Each is a fault this project already paid for. If you are tempted to simplify them, the reasons are inline
in `action.yml`:

| Step | Why |
|---|---|
| Install NVDA from this checkout, not `guidepup/setup-action` | The action predates the `@guidepup/setup` 0.24.0 CLI rewrite and installs the pre-0.29 layout, which guidepup ≥ 0.29 ignores. CI then fails with "NVDA is not supported", which reads like a missing install and is not one. |
| Disable the NVDA Speech Viewer | Guidepup ships it ON. Its focus event lands in the speech-log delta captured after activating a control, so an interaction probe records "NVDA Speech Viewer" instead of the page's response — and a check that only asserts the probe *fired* still passes. |
| Suppress Edge's first-run experience | A fresh profile shows a welcome/sign-in surface. On a page with no elements of a given type, NVDA's quick-nav escapes the document into that browser UI and produces phantom findings about Microsoft's own chrome. |
| Poll `/health.ready`, not `ok` | `ok` means only that the HTTP server is answering. A worker answered `ok` while NVDA could not start, which is how the capture pool's dominant failure hid for a day. |

**What this step does not prevent.** Rehearsal 2's two artifacts (#915, runs `34767932873` and `34768529975`)
recorded a focus order that reaches `New Tab`, `Refresh`, `View site information`, `Favorites`, `Profile 1`,
`Settings and more` and Copilot's `Chat`/`Guide` — real, permanent Edge chrome, not the first-run surface
this step suppresses, and present whether or not a profile is fresh. Measured (#1364): both walks start
already ON `youtube.com`, because the sweep's first control was the page's embedded YouTube player, task-word
matched, and activating it announced "Opening new window" (`interaction.formChanges[0]`) before the tab-order
walk began — the chrome is YouTube's own window, reached by walking clean off the `w3.org` document the setup
step has no bearing on. That is the excursion #1363 fixed: `interaction.leftSite`, recorded the moment an
activation's announcement or URL shows a changed origin, now stops the sweep and skips the focus pass entirely
(`site.ended()`, `capture-probes.mjs`), so neither rehearsal capture's own tab order is walked on a build with
that fix. Both artifacts predate it — `interaction.leftSite` is absent in each, which is how they still serve
as #1363's acceptance fixtures (`packages/cli/src/left-site-acceptance.test.ts`). This table row's own claim
was never wrong; the rehearsal account read it as covering an escape it does not name.

## What is verified, and what is not

Verified locally: 12 tests over the renderer and the pass/fail policy; the exit contract exercised four
ways (default passes despite a blocker, a threshold fails, a typo refuses with exit 2, a missing result
file refuses rather than reporting a clean page); and a real end-to-end run — real NVDA capture, real
judge, `4.1.2 blocker` on a genuinely unnamed button — rendered through the Action's own reporter.

The default `local` backend has been run end to end on a real capture: real NVDA, our own scorer, no LLM
called — one `4.1.2` blocker at 0.998 confidence with `button` quoted as the evidence.

**Not verified: the `anthropic` backend.** This project deliberately has no metered key, so that path is
written to the SDK spec and unexercised. It is no longer the default, which is the point: the untested
path is now the opt-in one.

**Verified on a real Windows runner (the V1 rehearsal, 2026-09-13):** the local backend's setup step installs `onnxruntime`, `transformers`, `safetensors` and `numpy`, pinned in `packages/scorer/requirements.txt`, and fetches the encoder. It installs no torch, which is a training-only dependency. With the pip cache restored, that step took 40.6 s and 41.7 s at `3bb1fddf` (V1 rehearsal 4, runs 34781484432 and 34782000257). The one run without a pip cache hit, at `0e809d13` (V1 rehearsal 1, run 34764686304, the same day), took 40.8 s, within the 32.6–53.1 s that the seven cache-hit runs took across their builds.

## Testing it without spending runner minutes

```bash
npm run doctor                  # whatever worker you have — fleet, or a local VM
./packages/lab/scripts/action-dry-run.sh https://example.com "Complete the checkout"
FAIL_ON=blocker ./packages/lab/scripts/action-dry-run.sh ...      # check the exit contract
```

`act` cannot run this action — it is Docker/Linux and NVDA needs Windows — so the dry run executes the
action's own bash for the steps that carry the logic, with `RUNNER_TEMP`, `GITHUB_OUTPUT` and
`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` set exactly as a runner sets them. It prints the summary a reviewer would read and
exits with the status the check would.

It cannot cover the Windows-only setup (NVDA, Speech Viewer, Edge policy, starting the worker) or
`gh pr comment`. Those setup steps are the least speculative part: `capture-regression.yml` already runs the
same commands on a real Windows runner for the same reasons.

One trap worth recording: run the action's snippets under **bash**, not zsh. `status` is a read-only
variable in zsh, so `status=0` fails with "read-only variable: status" — an artefact of the shell, not of
the action, which declares `shell: bash`.

## The demonstration: a real before/after pair

`projects.accesscomputing.uw.edu/au/before.html` and `after.html` — the University of Washington's
"Accessible University" demo, an expert-built inaccessible page and its accessible twin. Not ours, not
synthetic, and the closest thing to ground truth available in the wild. Both layers, LOCAL judge:

| | before (inaccessible) | after (accessible) |
|---|---|---|
| screen-reader layer | 1.1.1, 1.1.1, 4.1.2, **2.4.4**, **1.3.1** | **none** |
| axe | 1.4.3, 3.1.1, 1.1.1, 4.1.2, 1.4.1, 2.5.8 | **none** |

**Two findings only the screen-reader layer produced**, and the evidence is what a user hears:

```
2.4.4 Link Purpose      heard: "click here, link"
1.3.1 Info & Relationships   heard: "102 announcements, no heading among them"
```

axe reports neither, and not by oversight: its `link-name` rule asks whether a link HAS an accessible
name, and "click here" has one. Its heading rules are best-practice tagged. Both are judgements about the
*lived experience* — can you tell two links apart, can you skim the page — which a static DOM inspection
cannot make. Meanwhile axe found four things a screen reader cannot perceive at all (contrast, page
language, colour-only meaning, target size). Neither layer subsumes the other; that is ADR 0002's thesis
demonstrated on somebody else's pair rather than asserted on our own.

**The accessible version is clean on both layers.** That control matters more than the findings: the same
rules that fire five times on `before` fire zero times on `after`, which has 8 headings and descriptive
link text.

Measured in `907ed704` (the commit that added this rule — not a recurring board-gate metric, so cited rather than re-run): the new 2.4.4 rule fires **0** times on the 1,061 conformant pages of the corpus, and 38 times on their inaccessible twins.

One more thing this pair exposed, recorded because it changes what can be claimed: **the trained scorer
contributed nothing here.** It scored every criterion below 0.002 on the inaccessible page — 2.4.4 at
4.5e-12 — while scoring 0.997 and 0.985 on the corpus pages it was trained on. Every finding above came
from the deterministic rule layer. The scorer is sharp on its own distribution and silent off it, so
`judge-backend: local` is currently the rule layer doing the work on real sites. Retraining on the same
synthetic corpus will improve calibration, not generalisation.

## Tested against real sites in the wild

Run locally through `action-dry-run.sh`, full setup, both layers, LOCAL judge — no LLM, no key.

**`w3.org/WAI` — the W3C's own accessibility site.** 141 announcements, 19 headings, 15 landmarks captured.
**3 findings, all true positives, none from the trained scorer:** axe-core's rule layer flags three
`4.1.2` violations inside the page's embedded YouTube player (`aria-allowed-attr`, `aria-prohibited-attr`,
`button-name`). Reproduced on every measurement taken of this page — the V1 rehearsal's original run, its
re-run, and a fresh capture at commit `a8894c27`, 2026-09-17. (Announcement, heading and landmark counts
are the stable part; how many links or form fields a run REACHES varies run to run, and #1663 pinned why on
2026-09-23 across six measurements: almost all of it is the SWEEP, not the page. The page's own `domCensus`
held constant at `link=75` while reach went 13 → 17 → 40 → 80, including 13 vs 17 on one unchanged build —
so those figures measure the sweep improving, and its nondeterminism, rather than anything about w3.org.
Only the last step, 80 → 84, is the live page changing, and the census moved with it. Landing somewhere
different is not the cause of that step: across the three samples that record enough to re-derive it —
reach 80, 84, 84 — `compareIdentity` reads `SAME_DOCUMENT`, on `servedPath` (`https://www.w3.org/WAI/`)
alone, because each of those captures also names a second w3.org page, which leaves `title` incomparable.
The other three samples are result fixtures that drop what `documentIdentity` reads and answer
`UNCOMPARABLE`, so the 13 → 80 figures rest on the census above rather than on identity.)

**`news.ycombinator.com` — a real site, not built for accessibility.** 151 announcements, 3 findings, all
true positives: the search box is announced as a bare `edit` with no label (3.3.2, 4.1.2) and the logo has
no alt text (1.1.1). The 1.1.1 was caught by the `"missing image descriptions"` hint, i.e. by the fix for
NVDA's nondeterministic `"unlabeled"` prefix.

The same run with `axe: true` shows why there are two layers rather than one:

| criterion | screen-reader layer | axe |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1.1 image-alt | yes | yes — **the layers agree** |
| 4.1.2 label | yes | yes — **agree** |
| 1.4.3 contrast | — | yes — a screen reader cannot perceive it |
| 2.5.8 target size | — | yes — likewise |
| what a user actually HEARS (`edit`, and nothing else) | yes | axe cannot say this |

They corroborate where they overlap and each covers what the other structurally cannot. That is ADR 0002's
thesis, demonstrated rather than asserted.

Two rough edges found by doing this, both recorded rather than hidden:

- The prose used to state a count (`"1 confirmed failure(s)"`) above a table listing **three**, because
  `judge()` appends the rule layer's findings AFTER the local judge writes its summary. The summary now
  carries no number: the renderer counts the findings, so there is one source of truth.
- `taskCompletable` is derived from "did anything score as a blocker", because this layer has no head for
  task completion. On that site that reads `No` off an unlabelled search box, though the stated task
  ("read the top story") does not need search. It is a coarse proxy and is documented as one.

## What `task` actually does

Less than its name suggests, and worth knowing before you agonise over the wording.

**`task` is optional. It names a button for the probe to press, by a word from that button's label; it is a label for your report; and it does NOT change the analysis.** Leave it unset and the default, "Read and understand this page", is used. The report's `Task:` line and the summary's `**Task:**` line echo it and say so: they are not findings.

| setting | does the task matter? |
|---|---|
| `probe-forms: true` (**the default here**) | **Yes, for one of several things it presses.** A run under `probe-forms` always submits submit-like buttons and toggles checkboxes/radio buttons, whatever the task says; it activates any OTHER button only if its announced name shares a meaningful word with the task — so "show only bags" activates a *Bags* button, never *Delete account*. Disclosures are activated with no `probe-forms` gate at all. Asserted in `probe-choice.test.ts`; see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#it-operates-controls-on-the-page-and-one-probe-presses-buttons) for the full rule. |
| `judge-backend: anthropic` / `openai` | **Yes — it changes the verdict.** The LLM reads it and answers "could a screen-reader user finish this?" |
| `judge-backend: local` (default) | **Not for the verdict.** The scorer has no head for task completion and never sees the task — `docs/local-model.md` bars it as a model feature. It still reports `task-completable`, but on this backend that only means nothing scored as a blocker: a coarse proxy, not a judgement about your task (see above). |

`probe-navigation` is separate from all of the above, has no input to disable it here, and has no
task-word test either: it follows the first link on the page regardless of what `task` says. Rehearsal 3's
run against `https://www.w3.org/WAI` with the task `"Learn about web accessibility"` activated five
controls — one button whose name happened to share the word "Web" with the task (the word-match rule),
three submissions of the search form (submit-like, no task word needed) and one followed link
(`probe-navigation`, no task word tested at all). The word match governed exactly one of the five.

**A run can leave the page you gave it entirely, and this one did** — the followed link landed on a
second document, and the result says so itself: "THIS CAPTURE NAMED MORE THAN ONE DOCUMENT ... its
evidence was gathered across more than one page" is the tell. See
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#it-operates-controls-on-the-page-and-one-probe-presses-buttons) for the full
table of what a default run operates.

So on the defaults the task **does** shape what gets captured — it decides which non-submit, non-disclosure
buttons get activated, and therefore whether some 3.3.1 and 4.1.3 evidence exists at all — but most of what
a default run presses does not read the task. It does not shape the judgement, because the default scorer
never reads it.

This section previously said the task was inert on the defaults, which was true when `probe-forms`
defaulted to false. It changed deliberately: reviewing a page means checking what is on it, and an error
message nobody hears is only reachable by submitting. **The CLI still defaults it off**, because a
workflow tests your own application while `witness <url>` can be aimed at anyone's — see ADR 0002 and
`probe-choice.test.ts`, which asserts both defaults.

## A form that will not submit on a guess — the `forms` input

`probe-forms` submits with no valid input. That is exactly right for a form which validates everything,
and useless for one that will not submit until three fields are plausible — and those are the forms whose
error handling most needs reviewing. On such a page 3.3.1, 3.3.3 and 4.1.3 are not clean, they are
**structurally unreachable**: the evidence for them only exists after a control is operated.

`forms` names a config that says how to operate it (ADR 0024):

```yaml
- uses: a11ign/a11ign@v0.1.0
  # Pinned to v0.1.0, the first tagged release. Use the full 40-character commit SHA instead if your
  # CI must not move even across a release -- GitHub refuses an abbreviated one outright, it does not
  # just discourage it.
  with:
    url: https://staging.example.com/signup
    task: "Create an account"
    forms: .github/a11y-forms.yml
```

```yaml
# .github/a11y-forms.yml
url: https://staging.example.com/signup
states:
  - state: error            # 3.3.1 and 3.3.3: was the rejection announced, and did it say how to fix it?
    submit: "Create account"
    fields:
      - field: "Email address"      # the ACCESSIBLE NAME, which is what NVDA announces
        value: "ada@example.test"
      - field: "Confirm email"
        value: "different@example.test"
  - state: success          # 4.1.3: was the confirmation announced?
    submit: "Create account"
    fields:
      - field: "Email address"
        value: "ada@example.test"
      - field: "Confirm email"
        value: "ada@example.test"
```

Each state is captured and reported **separately** — they are different pages as far as a screen reader
user is concerned, and averaging them would hide the one that fails.

**You do not have to write it by hand.** `--emit-form-config` drafts one from what NVDA announced on the
page, so the field names in it are the names the screen reader actually uses rather than the ones in your
markup:

```bash
npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts https://staging.example.com/signup --task "Create an account" \
  --emit-form-config > .github/a11y-forms.yml
```

**A field the config names that cannot be addressed by its accessible name is a FINDING, not a
configuration error.** That is ADR 0024's central claim and it has a control group: the same config
against W3C's inaccessible survey demo filled ZERO fields and reported every one unbound, because its
controls have no accessible names — which is the 4.1.2 failure. A control a script cannot address by name
is one a screen reader user cannot address either.

Nothing is submitted that the config does not name. `probe-forms` and `forms` can both be set: where a
config applies it REPLACES the opportunistic probe for that capture rather than running beside it, because
pressing submit part-way through filling would attribute the evidence to a state that never existed.

## Several pages — the `urls` input

Give `urls` instead of `url` to test more than one page in one run. **Exactly one of the two:** both, or neither, is
refused before any setup is billed.

```yaml
      - uses: a11ign/a11ign@v0.1.0
        with:
          urls: |
            https://example.com/
            https://example.com/contact
            https://example.com/checkout
          task: Send an enquiry
          fail-on: serious
```

- **It is a list you write, not a crawl.** Nothing follows a link or reads a sitemap: the number of captures is the number
  of URLs, and a page you did not name is not examined. A list of one behaves exactly as `url` does.
- **The count comes first.** Before any capture the log says `3 captures, about 21 minutes (up to 27 if every page is as slow
  as the slowest measured; set the job's timeout-minutes to at least 27).` followed by the file the estimate comes from. It is an
  UPPER bound: a page whose probes navigate away finishes in a third of the time.
- **Above 5 captures it refuses, and you raise the cap on purpose.** Set `max-pages: 8` (a whole number, 1 to 25) on the
  step to allow eight. 25 is a ceiling the override cannot pass. Nothing else raises it: no environment variable and no
  config file. On this Action **you** pay for the runner minutes, so the refusal names them: eight captures is about 68
  runner-minutes billed to your account, $0.68 on a private repository at GitHub's $0.010 a Windows minute (a public
  repository on a standard runner is free). A page with N configured `forms` states counts as N captures.
- **Where the figures come from:** [`capture-cost.md`](./capture-cost.md) records each one, whether it was measured or chosen,
  and the run behind it. They are a reading at a moment, not a promise.
- **`timeout-minutes: 20` fits two captures and no more.** Raise it to the number the count line prints. A run that
  times out leaves no log and no artifact.
- **The refusal comes after setup only when the list is too long.** The both-or-neither check runs before setup; the cap
  check runs in the CLI, so a list over the cap still bills the setup (about a minute and a half) before it is refused.
- **Every page is reported on its own, in the order you gave them.** The summary opens with a roll-up (one row per page:
  outcome, findings, and whether it tripped `fail-on`), then each page's own report. **A page whose capture fails is shown
  as failed, the pages after it still run, and it is never reported as a clean page.** The exit code is 1 if any page
  tripped `fail-on`, otherwise 2 if any page could not be measured, otherwise 0.
- **With a `forms` config, every URL must be on the config's origin.** A list that crosses origins is refused whole, before
  the first page is captured.
- **`--emit-form-config` and `axe-results` take one page**, so they are refused with a list.

`result-json` for a list is one document, `{ "multiPage": true, "pages": [...] }`, with an entry per URL in the order
given: `url`, `status` (`captured` or `failed`), `results` (that page's own result, in the shape below; one per configured
form state) and, for a failed page, `error`. The `findings` output is the sum over the captured pages, and
`task-completable` is `true` only when every page was captured and judged completable. The CLI takes the same list:
`npm run witness -- <url> <url> ...` or `--urls "<url> <url>"`, with `--max-pages N` as the override.

## Logging in: `flows` and `login-flow`

To test a page BEHIND a login, give the Action a flows file and the name of the flow in it that logs in
([ADR 0038](adr/0038-authenticated-capture.md)). **Read [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#it-can-log-in-to-the-page-it-examines-and-then-it-holds-a-credential--2026-09-24-adr-0038)
first: the run holds a credential, and this section is only how to use it.**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/a11y.yml — the repository MUST be private (see below)
on: pull_request
jobs:
  a11ign:
    runs-on: windows-2022
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: a11ign/a11ign@v1
        env:                                   # the credential enters HERE, from GitHub Secrets, and nowhere else
          APP_TEST_USER: ${{ secrets.APP_TEST_USER }}
          APP_TEST_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.APP_TEST_PASSWORD }}
        with:
          url: https://staging.example.com/orders
          task: Review my recent orders
          flows: .github/a11y-flows.yml
          login-flow: login
```

```yaml
# .github/a11y-flows.yml
version: 1
origin: https://staging.example.com            # every goto is resolved against it, and leaving it fails the run
flows:
  login:
    steps:
      - goto: /login
      - fill: { field: "Email address", from-env: APP_TEST_USER }
      - fill: { field: "Password",      from-env: APP_TEST_PASSWORD }
      - press: "Sign in"
      - expect: { heading: "Dashboard" }       # REQUIRED as the last step of a login flow
```

**Steps** are `goto`, `fill`, `choose`, `check`, `press`, `expect` and `capture`, and nothing else: no script step, no
evaluated expression, no fixed sleep (`expect` waits for a condition, and its wait is bounded). A control is named by the
name a screen reader announces, never by selector, and `within:` and `nth:` tell two of the same name apart. **A login's
`fill` takes `from-env:` only**; a literal in the login flow is refused, and so is a literal typed into a password field in
any flow. A control the flow cannot address by its accessible name ends the run with `auth-login-failed` (`unbindable-field`):
that is a real 4.1.2 failure of your login form, and nothing behind it can be examined.

**What the run does to protect you, and what you must do.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Use** | A dedicated test account **without MFA or SSO**, on staging. Its username and password must each be **at least 8 characters and not an ordinary word** (`a11y-audit-7f3c`, not `admin`): a shorter value is refused, because hiding it would rewrite your page's own text. MFA, SSO and CAPTCHA are out of v1: a login step that fails on a page showing a reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha or Turnstile widget ends in `auth-challenge-detected`, which names the challenge and never answers it. |
| **Private repositories only** | A run on a repository that is **not private is refused before NVDA is installed** (`auth-refused-public-repository`), whichever of `comment-on-pr`, the job log and the artifact you meant to use: all of them, and the job summary, are readable by anyone on a public repository. |
| **What it presses** | Only what your files name. `probe-forms` and `probe-navigation` are turned off for an authenticated run **whatever you set** (an input's default cannot be told from a choice), and the run says so before it starts. The report and `result-json` list **What this run pressed**, by control name. |
| **The judge** | `judge-backend: local` (the default). `anthropic` or `openai` is refused for an authenticated run unless you also set `send-authenticated-transcript-to-judge-vendor: "true"`, which names the vendor in the log before the judge runs. |
| **The log** | The Action adds `::add-mask::` for the URL-encoded and base64 forms of every `from-env` value, which GitHub does not derive. Masks do not apply to FILES: every value is also replaced with `‹credential›` in `result-json` and the summary, and the count is disclosed ("2 announcements contained a value from your login and were redacted"). |
| **The cost** | At least one login per capture and one per capture for the rule layer, **stated before the run starts as a minimum** (a capture repeated because it did not read the page logs in again, up to 3 attempts each) and **reported afterwards as the number actually performed**: a multi-page run's `result-json` carries `logins` (`performed`, `workerAttempts`, `ruleLayerScans`, `minimum`) and its roll-up ends `Logins: N performed`. A run whose minimum passes 20 (`MAX_LOGINS`; the default 5-page run is 10, and 25 pages is 50) is refused before any worker is leased, with no override: split the list, or set `axe: false`. **A failed login stops the list**: pages after an authentication fault are reported `NOT ATTEMPTED` and make no login, so a wrong password is tried once and not once per page. Repeated logins can still trip a lockout or bot detection. |

The secrets reach the run through `env:` on **the step that calls the Action**, and the flows file names the variables. They are
never an input, because an input is interpolated into shell text. Whether a composite action's steps inherit that `env:` is
verified on the Action rehearsal recorded in [ADR 0038](adr/0038-authenticated-capture.md); if a runner ever does not, the fallback
is an input mapped into the step's `env:`, never into `run:` text.

`npm run auth:leak-check` is the check for whether a credential reaches a file, with a positive control. It has been read once against a real NVDA (2026-09-25, #2399: exit `0`, with a working positive control), and the first defence held on that page. **A full Action run has since been read against a page that is not a fixture (2026-09-26, #2561: this Action, a private repository, `windows-2022` with NVDA, a form login to `the-internet.herokuapp.com`):** it exited 0; the same job ran the three commands above as written (exits 0, 1, 0), and `auth:artifact-scan` read the report, the summary, the PR comment and the job log clean, with a positive control that exited 1. **Read that as one page, one runner and one afternoon:** the target prints its demo credentials on its login page, so a clean scan there proves the redaction and not that the tool never sees a credential, and it has no MFA, SSO or CAPTCHA. **Two things it showed:** a control is bound by its exact accessible name, and the target's Login button is named `U+F090 Login` (an icon glyph a stylesheet adds), so the flow had to say so, and the first run ended in `auth-login-failed` until it did; and a single-URL run states a login *minimum* but does not report the number performed (only a page list's `result-json` carries `logins`); **the redaction and the per-character refusal remain the defence to rely on**, and one reading is not a promise about yours. See the ADR for its three invocations and what each must exit.

`npm run auth:artifact-scan -- --path <file or directory> --user-env <VAR> --secret-env <VAR>` is the check for a REAL run's output, which `auth:leak-check` cannot be: that command reads only the `.json` it wrote itself from a fixture, so a credential in the markdown summary, a saved PR comment or a job log would read as clean because it was never looked at. This one scans every text file under the path, whatever its extension, with the same detector and the same exit codes (`0` clean, `1` a leak, `2` could not examine), and prints how much it examined before it says clean. An empty directory, or one holding only binary files, is exit `2`; a binary file is named as skipped and is not searched. **It covers only what it is pointed at:** a credential that reached a channel you did not point it at (a log you did not save, a comment you did not fetch, an upload step of your own) is not covered, and neither is one inside a skipped file.

## Outputs

| Output | Use |
|---|---|
| `findings` | Count of lived-experience findings (summed over the captured pages, for `urls`). |
| `task-completable` | Whether the judge thinks a screen-reader user could finish the stated task. On the default `local` backend this only means nothing scored as a blocker, a coarse proxy. |
| `result-json` | Path to the full result, including the transcript. Worth uploading as an artifact — the transcript is the evidence behind every finding. |
| `summary-md` | Path to the rendered report — the same markdown written to the job summary. Worth uploading alongside `result-json`: it is the route a CI-only consumer, with no access to the job summary, has to the human-readable report. |

`findings` counts every lived-experience finding, referred ones included; `fail-on` counts only the asserted ones. The log's count line splits them:
`a11ign: 3 finding(s) (2 asserted: 1 serious, 1 moderate; 1 referred); fail-on=<your fail-on>`.

## What `result-json` contains

`result-json` is the CLI's `--json` output, written by the capture step before the summary is rendered. These are
its top-level fields, and what each one lets you check.

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `url`, `task`, `screenReader` | What was examined, as given to the Action, and which screen reader read it (for example `NVDA`). |
| `verdict.findings` | The lived-experience findings. Each carries `wcag`, `severity` (`blocker`, `serious`, `moderate` or `minor`), `issue`, `evidence` (what the screen reader announced), `confidence`, `layer` (`perceive`, `navigate` or `interact`, from the criterion's WCAG principle) and, when a rule produced it, `mapping`. **`mapping: "conformance"` is an assertion: the evidence establishes the criterion is not met. Absent or `"secondary"` is a referral: worth a person's eyes, not a verdict.** The log line and the summary table say which is which. |
| `verdict.suppressed` | Predictions the trained scorer made and did not report, each with `criterion`, `score` and `reason`: a deterministic rule decides that criterion or subtype; the capture holds no evidence of the kind the criterion is about; or the page was outside the distribution the scorer was validated on, so nothing was scored. Recorded so a withheld prediction is visible, not silently dropped. |
| `verdict.novelty` | How close this page is to the scorer's training data: `nearestTrainingCosine`, `floor` and `inSupport`. `inSupport: false` means the scorer abstained (`verdict.abstained: true`, and no scorer findings), so its criteria are unchecked, not clean. `inSupport: null` means unknown, never safe. |
| `verdict.runtime`, `environment` | The versions that produced this result: the scorer's inference runtime, and the screen reader, browser, worker code and capture protocol. A disputed finding is traceable to them. |
| `outcomes` | One ACT outcome per WCAG 2.2 A/AA criterion: `criterion`, `outcome`, `reason` and, when the rule layer supplied it, `assessor: "axe-core"`. See below. |
| `conformance` | WCAG's five conformance requirements (Conformance Level, Full pages, Complete processes, Only Accessibility-Supported Ways of Using Technologies, Non-Interference), each with what this run `establishes` and its `limitation`. Neither is ever empty. This is where a partial examination is stated. |
| `earl` | The same outcomes as W3C EARL (JSON-LD): one `earl:Assertion` per criterion, `earl:mode` automatic, and the `reason` in `dct:description`, so a team already merging axe or Lighthouse results can read ours without a parser. |
| `transcript` | The screen reader's announcements, in order, while it read the page. A finding quoted from the page's announcements is borne out here. |
| `interaction` | What happened when controls were activated or Tab was pressed, keyed by probe channel, for example `formChanges`, `postSubmitNames`, `routeChange`, `focusOrder` and `focusReveal`. [What each probe drives](screenreader-coverage.md) is documented separately. |
| `structure` | What the structural sweeps found: headings, landmarks, form fields, graphics, links, lists, table cells, frames. |
| `ruleBased` | The rule layer's axe-core violations, or `null` when the rule layer produced no results (`axe: false`, or a scan that failed), which is not the same as `[]`. |
| `captureVerified`, `captureUnverifiedReason` | `false` when the capture could not be confirmed to have read the requested page. The reason is `wrong-content` (it read something else, such as browser chrome) or `contained` (it read only part of the page, usually a consent dialog). The summary then reports no findings and the run exits 2: a failed measurement, not a clean page. |
| `leftSite` | Where the examination ended because an activation took the browser off the page's site: the `control` activated, `from` and `to` (`null` when unknown), whether the worker `recorded` it or it was `derived` from the announcements (`source`), and the quoted `evidence`. `null` when every activation stayed on the page. `structure` and `interaction` are then only what was observed before it. |
| `artifactPath` | Where the capture behind this result was written, or `null` under `--no-keep`. |
| `pressed` | **Only on an authenticated run** ([below](#logging-in-flows-and-login-flow)): the controls the run pressed, by accessible name, never a value. An authenticated run presses only what its own files name (a login's `press:`, `check:` and `choose:` steps), so this is the whole list. Absent on every other run. |

### Reading `outcomes`

`outcome` is one of ACT's five values, and `reason` always says why:

| `outcome` | Means |
|---|---|
| `failed` | Asserted: a conformance-mapped finding establishes this criterion is not met. |
| `cantTell` | Referred: a finding suggests a problem but its rule is stricter or looser than the criterion, or the examination could not decide (for example the scorer abstained, the examination ended or a sweep stopped short, the evidence was not collected, only one control was examined, or two layers disagree). Not a pass. |
| `passed` | Content of the relevant kind was examined in full and no failure was found. |
| `inapplicable` | Nothing of the kind this criterion is about was on the page. |
| `untested` | No assessor in this tool covers this criterion. |

For a criterion the screen reader covers, a conformance-mapped finding decides first, then a scorer abstention, then an
examination that ended or stopped short; only after those may nothing found read `inapplicable`. When axe-core covers
the same criterion, what the screen reader met stands, and its own `failed` is never changed. An axe violation turns
a screen-reader `cantTell` into `failed` with `assessor: "axe-core"`, but beside a screen-reader `passed` or
`inapplicable` it becomes `cantTell`, because the two layers examined different things and disagree. For a criterion
only axe-core covers, a clean axe result reads `cantTell`, never `passed`: automated rules cover only part of any
criterion.

**A result with no findings is not a clean page until `outcomes` and `conformance` say what was examined.** A CI job
deciding whether to fail a build should read them, not `findings` alone.
