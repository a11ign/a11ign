# Architecture decision records

One file per decision, numbered in the order it was taken. An ADR records **what was decided, what it cost,
and what would falsify it** — so a future reader can tell a considered choice from an accident, and knows
which measurement to repeat before overturning it.

Several of these were changed by later evidence. That is recorded *in the original*, as a dated update,
rather than by quietly editing the decision — a decision record that only shows the final answer cannot tell
you which arguments have already been tried.

## If you read only one

**[0015](./0015-one-defect-per-page-taught-the-scorer-to-veto.md)** is the clearest example of what these
records are for. It starts from a single missed page, follows three whys into a measured cause — the same
announcement scoring 0.924042 on two pages and 0.452519 on a third — and ends with a corpus change and a
gate. It also corrects an inference in 0010 rather than leaving the older record to be believed.

## Writing a new one

Number it next, and keep the shape the existing ones use: **Context** (what forced a decision), **Decision**
(what, in the imperative), **Consequences** (including the ones you do not like), **Alternatives rejected**
(with the reason each was rejected — this is the section future readers actually use), and where it applies,
**what would falsify this**.

Prefer a measurement to an argument. If a number here is not measured, say so in the sentence that uses it.
