# Why a tracker row goes stale — swept 2026-09-06, with the command that settled each one

Nine rows were found already-done or wrongly-premised in one day, every one by a worker about to start
building against it. That is a class, not nine accidents, and this is the sweep that establishes what the
class actually is.

**Every verdict below was produced by RUNNING something.** Where a row carries its own `## Open-check`,
that is what was run — the row's own falsifier, executed a second time. No verdict here comes from reading
a row and forming an opinion about it.

## What the sweep found

| row | its own check, re-run | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **#42** *Nothing has been installed from a published tarball* | `npm run gate:isolation` → **6/6 packages usable installed**, every subpath resolving, no undeclared dependency | **The work is DONE and passing.** Its acceptance is `release:gate:ci`, which stops at stage 3 on an unrelated blocker — see below. Labelled `ready`. |
| **#4** *action-smoke red for 85 consecutive runs* | `gh run list --workflow=action-smoke.yml --limit 300` → **146 consecutive failures**; last success `2026-09-03T12:16:52Z` | **LIVE, and understated — by both earlier counts, including mine.** See *a count over a window reports the window* below. The cause is not the action: the log reads `Captured 89 announcements` and then fails in the scorer. |
| **#30** *A GET form submit changes the URL, so the census refuses 18 records* | `grep submitOnlyAddedAQueryString packages/evidence/src/verify.ts` → defined at 985, consulted at 1005; `verify.test.ts` carries tests named `#30:` | **Code half DONE and tested.** Only the fleet measurement remains (`lab:job -e job=rules-real-pages` must show the 18 move). Labelled `ready`, which reads as buildable. |
| **#51** *A 15 s wall-clock assertion cannot tell a hang from a loaded host* | `grep CONTROL_DEGRADED_MS\|controlSpawnMs\|timedOut packages/lab/src/packaging/no-worker-refusal.test.ts` → all three present | **DONE.** The test now measures a control spawn and separates host degradation from a hang. |
| **#13** *The trainer rotates its one retained generation at STARTUP* | `grep rmtree/move packages/lab/scripts/train-screenreader-model.py` → still at lines 236-239 | **Premise TRUE, concern ANSWERED.** `train-rotation-safety.test.ts` pins the property that actually protects the generation (the report is written atomically and last, so a dying train never reaches the rotation branch). Restate; do not close. |
| **#11** *`diagnose-false-positives.py` exits 0 on an empty corpus* | `grep 'return 0' packages/lab/scripts/diagnose-false-positives.py` → line 118, unconditional | **LIVE and accurate.** A deliberate non-fix, documented as such in `exit-code-contract.test.ts`'s `DOCUMENTED_PY`. The control case for this sweep: a row can stay open and stay right. |
| **#52** *The `runs/` rule is in CLAUDE.md as a temporary home* | the row's OWN open-check, re-run: `git ls-tree origin/main -- docs/roles/README.md` (read in a11ign/agent-org's tree, where the tool's files now live) → **present**; `agent/roles-readme` **0 ahead of main** | **UNBLOCKED and actionable.** The row's "Blocked until `agent/roles-readme` merges" is the stale part. *(This corrects the first pass of this sweep, which called it "ambiguous, needs a decision" — that reading came from a label and a summary rather than from the row, which states its decision in its first paragraph. The row was not ambiguous; the sweep was careless, and re-running the row's own check is what fixed it.)* |
| **#33** *The corpus is 85 pages from two publishers* | `REAL_PAGES` measured directly → **98 entries, 0 without a source, 50 distinct claim sources, 68 hosts** | **Premise REFUTED on its numbers; concern survives in a sharper form.** All 8 pages published as INACCESSIBLE are `w3.org` or ours, which `real-page-corpus.test.ts:181` already pins. The row sends someone to add publishers; what is missing is one page somebody else publishes as inaccessible. |

## THE FINDING: three publish-blockers, one root cause, and no row says so

`action-smoke` (#4) fails with:

```
the local scorer exited 1: screen-reader scorer failed: scorer representation schema does not match the runtime
```

`release:gate:ci` (#42's acceptance) stops at stage 3 with:

```
BLOCKED  a schema migration is open: screenreader-structured-v18 -> screenreader-structured-v19
```

These are the same fact, measured two ways:

```
runtime featurizer   FEATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION = "screenreader-structured-v19"   (screenreader_features.py:112)
shipped weights      screenreader-structured-v18                              (schema-migration.json, and
                                                                              gate:isolation prints it)
```

`score.py`'s `verify_artifact` refuses, correctly. So **#4 and #42 are both unactionable until the v18→v19
migration closes, which is #35 — fleet-gated on the retrain after the in-flight recapture.** Neither row
names that dependency, and both read as independently pickable publish-blockers.

**The action itself is fine.** `Captured 89 announcements` is in the failing log, after axe-core ran and
the worker answered. A reader who takes "red for 85 consecutive runs" at face value goes looking for a
broken action; the action works end to end and one artefact stamp is wrong.

## A COUNT OVER A WINDOW REPORTS THE WINDOW, NOT THE STREAK — and it bit three times in one row

#4 carried two numbers that disagreed with each other: the title said *85 consecutive* and the body said
*114 success, 85 failure* over 200 runs. Those are a streak and a total, and over a 200-run window both
were true at once — the newest 85 all red, the 114 greens all older.

**The first sweep of this row then reported 99 consecutive over a 100-run window, and that was wrong the
same way.** Over 300 runs, reaching back to 2026-08-28:

```
runs listed 300 · failure 176 · success 124
CONSECUTIVE failures from newest: 146
most recent SUCCESS: 2026-09-03T12:16:52Z   <- the day schema-migration.json records v18 -> v19 opening
```

A streak longer than the window is reported as the window. Three counts, three windows, three different
answers, and the only one that means anything is the one whose window is provably longer than the streak
it measures — which is why the number above is quoted with its window and its oldest run.

**The DATE was right in every version and was the load-bearing fact all along.** `2026-09-03T12:16` is
the migration opening. A date cannot be truncated by a window; a count can. Where both are available,
the date is the one to quote.

## What actually makes a row go stale

The hypothesis this sweep was given was that **a row records a mechanism as well as a symptom, and the
mechanism is the half that rots** — `not-working.md` §26's shape, in the tracker rather than in the code.
**The evidence does not support that as the main driver**, and the distinction matters because the two
have different remedies.

§26's shape appeared exactly once here: **#12**, whose open-check grepped `endsWith` in
`exit-code-contract.test.ts`, matched the `.mjs`/`.ts` line, stopped, found a sibling comment agreeing with
it, and concluded a gap was open that had been closed hours earlier. That is a mechanism rotting, and it is
the most expensive single instance because it misled an *instrument* rather than a reader.

Every other row went stale by a different route, and they share one property:

> **A row's premise is verified ONCE, at filing time. Everything that could re-verify it — the
> `Open-check`, the `Acceptance` command, the `ready` label — is written to be READ rather than RUN, and
> nothing re-runs it. The row does not rot; the world moves and the row is never asked again.**

Read that way, the nine sort cleanly into four shapes, and only the first is §26:

1. **The mechanism rotted** (#12). A cited fact stopped being true and two copies corroborated each other.
   *Remedy: pin the citation with a test — done, in `gate-partial-corpus-contract.test.ts`.*
2. **The work landed and nothing re-read the row** (#10, #27, #45, #51, #52, #60). The premise was true,
   the fix merged, the row stayed. *Remedy: re-run the open-check at merge, not at filing.*
   **#52 is the cleanest specimen in the whole sweep**, because the row was right about everything
   *including its own precondition*: it recorded "Blocked until `agent/roles-readme` merges" and an
   open-check reading `(absent — still on agent/roles-readme, unmerged)`. Re-running that one command
   returns `docs/roles/README.md` (a11ign/agent-org's path), and the branch is 0 commits ahead of main. Nothing rotted and nothing
   was written carelessly — the precondition was met and the row was never asked again. It is also the
   instance that shows the remedy is not "write better rows": the row could not have been written better.
3. **The acceptance command cannot pass, for a reason outside the row** (#4, #42, and #10 in a second way —
   its acceptance path `packages/scorer/python/` collects zero tests and exits 5). A row whose falsifier is
   broken can never be closed by evidence, so it stays open on the strength of nobody checking.
   *Remedy: run the acceptance command WHEN THE ROW IS FILED. All three failures here are visible in one
   run and none needs the fleet.*
4. **The label outlived the state** (#30, #33). Work reduced the row to a fleet-gated measurement while the
   `ready` label still advertised it as buildable — which is precisely what makes a worker pull it.
   *Remedy: `ready` is a claim that a fleet-free path to acceptance exists; it should be dropped the
   moment that stops being true.*

**The cheapest single change is shape 3, and it is one command.** A row is filed with an acceptance
command nobody has ever executed; executing it once at filing time would have caught #4, #42 and #10 —
three of the nine — before either cost a dispatch. The second cheapest is shape 2: the row's own
`Open-check` is the merge-time question, and it is already written down.

**And shape 4 says something about the `ready` label that the board should decide rather than infer.**
`ready` currently means "somebody thought this was pickable when they filed it". Every row in shape 4 was
`ready` and none was pickable. If `ready` instead meant "the acceptance command has been run and names a
fleet-free failure", it would be a claim about the present rather than a memory of the past — and it is
checkable, because running an acceptance command is what produces it.

## What this sweep did NOT establish

- **Rows behind a fleet gate were not swept**, except where their premise names a file this checkout
  holds. `runs/` here is a copy, and CLAUDE.md's own rule is that a gate reading it gives a verdict only
  to the agent driving the lab. A premise about the corpus is not answerable from here and saying
  otherwise would be the defect this document is about.
- **`decision` rows were not swept.** They are waiting on a person, not on a fact, and re-running anything
  would not move them.
- **This is 8 rows of 53.** The claim is about the SHAPES, which repeat, not about the remaining 45 being
  sound.
