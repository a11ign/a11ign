# What the screen reader actually does — coverage and gaps

The point of this project is the *lived* assistive-technology experience, so the honest question
is not "does the capture work" but **"which of the things a screen-reader user does have we
actually driven?"** Anything we have not driven is not evidence we are missing — it is a claim
we cannot make.

This file is the map. Keep it current when you add a probe; it is how the next agent knows what
is real.

## Driven today

| What a user does | How we drive it | Field | WCAG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read the page start to finish | line-by-line stepping | `transcript` | — |
| Jump heading to heading | `H` / `Shift+H` | `structure.headings` | 1.3.1, 2.4.6 |
| Jump between regions | `D` / `Shift+D` | `structure.landmarks` (**incomplete, see caveat**) | 1.3.1, 2.4.1 |
| Tab-target hunt for controls | `F` / `Shift+F` | `structure.formFields` | 1.3.1, 4.1.2 |
| Operate a control, hear the result | activate in place, diff the speech log | `interaction.stateChanges` | 4.1.2 |
| Submit a form, hear the errors | submit, then re-scan fields | `interaction.formChanges`, `postSubmitFields` | 3.3.1, 3.3.3 |
| Find the images | `G` / `Shift+G` | `structure.graphics` | 1.1.1 |
| Hear link text out of context | `K` / `Shift+K` | `structure.links` | 2.4.4, 2.4.9 |
| Meet a list | `L` / `Shift+L` | `structure.lists` | 1.3.1 |
| Read a table cell by cell | `T`, then `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow` (**opt-in, see caveat**) | `structure.tableCells` | 1.3.1 |
| Tab through the page | `Tab` + report focus (on by default) | `interaction.focusOrder` | 2.1.2, **2.1.1**, **2.4.1**, **2.4.3** |
| (measure only) whether focus was CONFINED to a ring | none — computed from the walk | `focusConfinement` diagnostic | — |
| Follow a link and re-read the title | activate a navigation control, ask NVDA for the title before and after (**opt-in**) | `interaction.routeChange` | **2.4.2**, 2.4.1 |
| **Fill a form the way its owner says it works, then submit** | walk to each field by ACCESSIBLE NAME, type the declared value, press the named control (**needs a config**) | `interaction.formChanges` (`kind: "submit"`), `postSubmitFields`, `interaction.formFill` | **3.3.1**, **3.3.3**, **4.1.3** |
| Focus a control and see whether the page REVEALS something | walk up to 8 tab stops, census before and after, Escape twice | `interaction.focusReveal` (**opt-in**, `probeFocusReveal`) | **1.4.13** |
| Have focus TAKEN AWAY the instant it arrives | a `focusin`/`focusout` listener installed over CDP; a same-id pair inside 50 ms is F55 | `interaction.focusEvents` (rides `probeFocus`) | **2.4.7**, 2.1.1, 3.2.1 |
| Discover that focus alone changed the page's context | tab, then ask NVDA for the title and first heading again | `interaction.focusContext` (**opt-in**, `probeFocusContext`) | **3.2.1** |
| Try to LEAVE a dialog with Escape | press Escape twice — NVDA eats the first, leaving focus mode | `interaction.dialogEscape` (**opt-in**, `probeDialog`) | **2.1.2** |
| Move INSIDE a widget with the arrow keys | arrows in whatever the focus probe landed on | `interaction.arrowNavigation` (**opt-in**, `probeArrows`) | **2.1.1** |
| Type into a field and hear the feedback | type `123456`, then read what was announced | `interaction.typedFeedback` (**opt-in**, `probeTyping`) | **3.2.2** |

**Every one of the six above is gated on `probeFocus`** — they act on whatever the focus walk landed on,
so without it they have nothing to act upon and report their own absence rather than a page fact.

The first nine are on by default and cost ~15–17 s per capture. The rest are opt-in per
capture — `"probeFocus": true` (adds ~8 s), `"probeNavigation": true`, `"probeTables": true` (see the
caveat below), and `"formState"`.

**The last row is the only one driven by a DECLARATION rather than by a flag**, and that is what makes it
different in kind. Every other probe decides for itself what to operate, from a heuristic this project
wrote; a `formState` names the fields, the values and the control, so the tool operates what the page's
owner said rather than what it guessed. ADR 0024, and `SECURITY.md` records what widens as a result — it
TYPES VALUES, which nothing else here does.

It is what makes 3.3.1, 3.3.3 and 4.1.3 reachable on a form that will not submit on a guess. `probeForms`
submits with no valid input, which is enough for a form that validates everything and useless for one
that wants three plausible fields first — and on such a page those criteria are not clean, they are
**structurally unreachable**, because their evidence only exists after a control is operated. Note also
what a config CANNOT do: a field it names that has no accessible name is reported as a 4.1.2 FINDING
rather than a configuration error, because a control a script cannot address by name is one a screen
reader user cannot address either.

### Added 2026-08-22: four criteria a static analyser structurally cannot reach

The same two probes now feed four more criteria. Each is recorded as PARTIAL in `criterion-coverage.ts`
with the failure mode it covers and the one it does not, and each was scoped against W3C's own guidance
rather than assumed — **2.4.1's scope changed as a result**, because a skip link is not required (H69 and
ARIA11 satisfy it alone), so detecting its absence would have fired on conformant pages.

| criterion | what is assessed | why markup cannot answer it |
|---|---|---|
| **2.1.1** Keyboard | a control present in reading order that Tab never reaches | reachability is a runtime property of focus, not of the DOM |
| **2.4.1** Bypass Blocks | a skip link that is present and **inert** | a checker sees a link and a plausible `href` and passes it |
| **2.4.2** Page Titled | the route changes and the title does **not** | the markup is valid at every instant; the failure is the TRANSITION |
| **2.4.3** Focus Order | the tab order **contradicts** the reading order | the DOM has no reading order to contradict until something walks the page |

Three measurement traps, all found by capturing rather than reasoning:

- **The tab order is a CYCLE.** Past the last control, Tab returns to the first, so a faithful recording
  ends by repeating what it began with — comparing raw made the CONFORMANT variant differ from itself.
  Compare each control's first visit.
- **The focus probe truncates at 12 stops** on every corpus page, so "absent from `focusOrder`" almost
  never means "unreachable". 2.1.1 is positional for that reason: a control counts as unreachable only when
  something LATER in reading order was reached.
- **Silence is not the signal you want.** The stale-title page announced `"visited"` — the link's own
  state, which names nothing about where the user is. A rule keyed on "nothing was announced" would have
  stayed mute on the exact page it was written for.

### Resolved 2026-08-08: `focusOrder` is now assessed, and reachable

The caveat below described a real defect and it is fixed. `probeFocus` is exposed as `--no-probe-focus`
(CLI) and `probe-focus` (Action), ON by default in both because Tab activates nothing — the opposite of
`probe-forms`, and the reason the defaults differ. `addKeyboardTrap` reads the evidence and claims 2.1.2.

The rule is deliberately conservative and needs TWO signals: focus repeating at the end of the tab order,
AND fewer distinct controls reached than the form-field sweep found. The capture probe had always recorded
the first and refused to interpret it — "which one it is, is the judge's call" — because a repeat alone
also happens at the end of a short document, and would fire on a single stale announcement.

Mapped SECONDARY: 2.1.2 permits an escape by other standard means, and permits a non-standard one if the
user is advised of it. We press Tab only and cannot see an on-page advisory.

#### What the probe CANNOT see: a trap you can move around inside

Recorded 2026-08-27, while authoring a second 2.1.2 case, and it is the sharp half of "we press Tab only".

`probeFocusOrder` marks `stalled` when the **same** control repeats `TRAP_REPEATS` times. That catches a
trap which pins focus to one element — a `keydown` handler cancelling Tab, or blur-revalidation
refocusing the field it rejected. It cannot catch the canonical modal focus trap, where focus **cycles
among the modal's own controls for ever**: focus moves on every press, so the recording reads `cycled`,
which is exactly what a conformant page does when Tab wraps past its last control.

A genuine 2.1.2 failure and a correct page produce the same shape. That is not a bug in the rule — the
rule is right to refuse — it is evidence the probe does not gather.

**The first version of that corpus case used the cycling shape and would have entered the corpus BLIND.**
It was caught by `--pipeline=verify --only=` before any capture was paid for, and rewritten to a
single-field trap the probe can express. A canary that cannot express the fault is worthless, and choosing
one that could not is the mistake this note exists to stop repeating.

#### BUILT 2026-08-28 — the second route below, and the corpus case that proves it

The limitation above is true of the CYCLE and not of its CONTENTS. A conformant wrap visits everything
the page has; a modal cycle visits what the dialog has, and the structural sweep already records what the
whole page has. So a closed cycle covering **fewer distinct stops than the sweep found form fields** is a
trap, and that evidence is in every capture already taken — no probe change, no recapture.

`keyboard-trap-modal-cycle` is the canary, and it is the shape this note says would have entered the
corpus blind: a `focusin` guard pulling focus back to a dialog's first control, three controls in the
dialog and four fields behind it. Measured:

| | stops | `cycled` | `stalled` | distinct | swept fields |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| trapped | 6 | true | **false** | **3** | 5 |
| conformant | 17 | true | false | 14 | 5 |

`stalled` is false on the trap, which is the blind spot exactly; the distinct count separates them. Swept
across every capture on disk: **0 fires on a conformant page, 2,134 examined**, and `rules:gate` reports
`2.1.2:focus-trapped 1/1 EXACT` with 0 false positives over 934 conformant records.

Decided from the STOPS, not from the probe's `cycled`/`truncated` mark, because the rule in `rules.ts`
has no diagnostics — a formulation needing the mark could not be the same decision in both places, and
this repo pays more for one fact stated two ways than for a slightly indirect test.
`keyboard-trap.corpus.test.ts` pins the two equal over the whole corpus.

**WIDER THAN IT WAS: the cycling detection this section described has itself been withdrawn.** Two rules
were measured against 86 conformant real pages on 2026-08-28 and both failed — the wider tab-stop
denominator with 9 new findings, and the original form-field cycling branch with 7. tfl.gov.uk reads ring 5
against 28 swept controls (three of them "Accept all cookies"); networkrail ring 4 of 7; the corpus case
they were built for, ring 3 of 5. **The same evidence.** 2.1.2 now detects only a STALL.

The rest of this section is kept because the reasoning is what makes the remaining gap tractable. A dialog holding MOST of a page's
controls cycles over nearly everything, so the subset shrinks toward nothing — worst exactly where the
failure is most total.

**A tab-stop denominator was built for this and withdrawn the same day.** The idea: stop asking "did focus
reach every FORM FIELD" (2.1.2 asks about the page) and measure the ring against `domCensus.tabbable`, the
page's rendered tab stops. It separated the corpus perfectly — conformant **14 distinct stops of 14
tabbable**, trapped **3 of 14** — and then `rules-real-pages` scored it on 86 conformant real pages:

    9 NEW 2.1.2 findings, ~10% of conformant pages

Measured on three of them, with the probe's own marks beside the rule's:

| page | distinct | tabbable | probe |
|---|---|---|---|
| tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/ | 5 | 67 | `cycled=true truncated=false` |
| gov.scot/publications/ | 7 | 116 | `cycled=true truncated=false` |

**The walks genuinely closed** — probe and rule agree, so it is neither truncation nor a weak wrap test,
which were the two hypotheses. The rings are real: tfl's first stop sits inside the cookie banner,
gov.scot's is a date-picker overlay. Six of the nine open with a consent banner, and a systematic pattern
across independent publishers is the signature of a TOOL problem rather than nine site bugs.

So no floor fixes it. **The difference between a conformant modal and a trap is not how much of the page
the ring covers — it is whether focus can LEAVE**, and nothing here presses Escape, so nothing here can
ask. Tuning the floor until real pages went quiet would be fitting a threshold to a symptom, which is how
a rule comes to be clean by going deaf.

`tabbable` is KEPT in the census: it was never the wrong measurement, only an insufficient one, and it is
the denominator the Escape-based rule will need.

**And the Escape route below was dismissed for a reason that does not apply.** The argument was that on a
conformant page with no dialog Escape reveals nothing new, so it cannot discriminate. True, and it answers
the wrong question — the comparison that matters is a dialog that RELEASES focus against one that does not.
Escape is exactly that test. What stands is the complication the entry already names: Escape is also NVDA's
own route out of focus mode, so a probe pressing it must be able to attribute the result.

Two routes in, and a THIRD that turned out to be the right one — see above. The original pair:

- **Press Escape and see whether focus leaves.** The direct answer, and it is what "Dialogs and modals"
  in *Not driven yet* already prescribes. The complication is that Escape is *also* NVDA's own route out
  of focus mode (`script_disablePassThrough`, which `anchorToTop` relies on), so a probe pressing it is
  changing two things at once and the evidence would not say which moved.
- **Compare the cycle's SIZE against the page's.** Needs no new keystroke and uses evidence already
  captured: when `cycled` is true the probe has seen the whole cycle, so a cycle covering materially
  fewer controls than `domCensus.formField` reports means focus is confined to a subset of the page.
  Cheaper and weaker — it would miss a trap in a modal containing most of the page's controls. **Built,
  and it is the section above.** It compares against the SWEEP's form fields rather than
  `domCensus.formField`, because the sweep's count travels in every capture while the DOM census is a
  diagnostic the rules layer cannot see.

2.1.2 is now claimed for both the pinned-focus mode and the cycling mode, with the residual gap named
above. The first route — pressing Escape — remains untaken, and would close it.

The original report follows, because the shape of the defect is worth keeping: a probe that ran, evidence
nobody read, and a coverage table claiming the criterion anyway.

### Original caveat: `focusOrder` was CAPTURED and never ASSESSED

This row used to claim 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap and 2.4.3 Focus Order. It should not have. The probe works
and records what it hears, but:

- **no rule and no scorer head reads `interaction.focusOrder`** — grep it: the only consumers are
  `evidence-diff.mjs` and `repeat-capture.mjs`, both stability tooling. A keyboard trap sitting in that
  array is reported to nobody.
- **no user could turn it on.** `probeFocus` is accepted over the wire by `server.mjs` and set by nothing:
  there is no CLI flag and no Action input. Nothing in the dataset uses it either.

So the honest entry is "none". This matters more than a normal gap because 2.1.2 is one of the four
**non-interference** criteria in WCAG §5.2.5, which apply to ALL content on a page whether or not it is
relied upon to meet any other criterion — and a keyboard trap is a total blocker, not a degradation.
`packages/evidence/src/conformance.ts` therefore reports 2.1.2 as NOT assessed, and its tests assert that
capturing evidence never counts as assessing it.

Two ways forward, and the choice is not obvious: build a deterministic trap rule over `focusOrder`
(a cycle that revisits a subset while the form-field sweep found controls it never reaches), or delete
the probe. Building it is the better answer given §5.2.5, but it needs fixtures and a false-positive
budget of its own — a wrongly reported keyboard trap is a serious accusation.

### Caveat: `landmarks` cannot see a landmark that spans the whole document

`structure.landmarks` is swept with `D`/`Shift+D`, and quick navigation **cannot reach a landmark that
contains the caret**. NVDA's `browseMode.py` searches by START position — `_iterNodesByType(type,
"next"|"previous", info)` — and an enclosing item requires a third direction, `"up"`, which no quick-nav
key uses. Its own docs say a landmark's name is spoken "when jumping inside from **outside**" it.

So a landmark wrapping the entire page with nothing outside it is invisible to the sweep, because every
position the caret can occupy is inside it. Anchoring does not help and makes it worse — `Ctrl+Home` is
still inside a `<main>` that starts at document position 0, and adding an anchor before this sweep turned
`["form, Hire duration"]` into `[]`.

**How often it actually bites is now measured per capture, and it is NOT most pages.** When a page has a
`<nav>` or header OUTSIDE `main`, the caret can sit outside it and quick navigation enters it normally —
and on entry NVDA announces the landmark's first content (`"Account help, heading, level 1"`), not the
word "main". Counting captures whose landmark list lacks the literal string "main" therefore reports
2,063 of 2,064, which is an over-count and was briefly recorded here as fact. Only pages where a landmark
encloses everything truncate; `structureCrossCheck` names those individually.

**What this does and does not affect, measured rather than assumed:**

- **Dataset signals: unaffected.** All 58 landmark cases use `{type: "structure-empty", field:
  "landmarks"}`, and their *bad* variants contain no landmark elements at all — so `[]` is the correct
  answer, and `check-signals` scores them 58/58 discriminating.
- **The local model: unaffected.** The exporter excludes `1.3.1:missing-landmark` outright.
- **The judge: affected.** It sees `landmarks: []` on a page that does have a `main`, and inferring
  "regions are unmarked" from that is wrong. This is why the judge prompt now says
  "'Landmarks/regions: NONE found' alone is not a WCAG failure without direct evidence".

**Read an empty `landmarks` as "no landmark was reachable by quick navigation", never as "the page
exposes none."** They are different claims, and only the first one is evidence.

### The completeness oracle: ask Chromium, not the screen reader

Every capture now records `structureCensus` — how many headings, landmarks, links and graphics the PAGE
exposes, from `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` over the DevTools socket the capture already holds open — and
`structureCrossCheck`, which names any disagreement `phantom` (sweep found more) or `truncated` (fewer).

**It costs nothing.** Measured 22.0 s and 19.7 s against a 19–20 s baseline: one CDP call is
milliseconds. Asking NVDA's own Elements List (`NVDA+F7`) for the same answer is authoritative and
agrees exactly — both report 2 landmarks where the sweep reports 1 — but costs **~11 s** per capture for
landmarks alone, and **~39 s** for all five types it supports (20 s → 59 s measured), because every
keystroke waits on guidepup's 1 s speech-quiet debounce. That is the difference between a check that runs
on every capture and one nobody can afford. `"probeElementsList": true` remains available as a
second opinion on the oracle itself.

**The census is an ORACLE, never evidence.** What the screen reader announced stays the evidence;
`docs/local-model.md` bars the accessibility tree from being a model feature. Its only job is to make an
under-reporting sweep distinguishable from a page that genuinely has nothing — which is the one thing no
amount of screen-reader output can tell you on its own.

It earned this immediately: it found a phantom heading (sweep 3, page 2) caused by `CONTAINER_PREFIX`
matching only `"<name> region,"` and not `"<name>, region,"`. 58 captures carried a duplicate; all 58 are
recaptured and every cross-checked capture now agrees.

### Caveat: table cells remain opt-in

`tableCells` works and it discriminates — a table with `<th>` announces `"Departs, column 2,
09:15"` where one without says `"column 2, 09:15"`, which is the 1.3.1 evidence nothing else
gives us. It is **not yet deterministic**, so it remains off for ordinary captures. Table cases
explicitly request the probe and use only the announced cell wording, never the number of cells, as
dataset evidence; a pair without an observable bad cell is skipped rather than treated as a match.

Measured over 18 captures of one unchanged page across three workers: 4, 2, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4 cells,
and worse before the settle was added. In the same captures the quick-nav sweeps were rock steady
— `graphics`, `links`, `lists`, `landmarks` and `formFields` identical every time — so this is
specific to `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow` grid navigation and how fast NVDA updates its speech log, not to the
capture as a whole.

Three fixes each helped and none cured it: priming the caret into the grid (`T` lands on the
caption, so the first cell move answers `"Not in a table cell"`), treating a silent step as
retryable rather than final, and a 500 ms settle between keystroke and read. A field that varies
with timing is indistinguishable from a page that genuinely differs, which is exactly the
contamination this project exists to avoid.

**Update: much improved, but NOT deterministic — and I overclaimed this once.** Two eight-run sessions
gave 4 cells identically (7/7 and 5/5), which I recorded as "deterministic". A third session then gave
**3, 4, 4, 4** among captures that all read the page correctly, so that claim was wrong.

The cause is visible in the transcripts: NVDA sometimes announces the table's `caption` and sometimes
does not, and the cell walk inherits that. Two distinct 9-phrase transcripts appear for the same page.
So the variation is in **NVDA's announcement**, not in the probe or its timing — a different and much
smaller problem than the 4/2/4/4/1/4/4 spread it started with, but not zero.

That is why it stays opt-in. A signal keyed on cell COUNT would be unreliable; one keyed on whether a
header word precedes the coordinates would not be, since that difference held in every capture.

Separately, roughly 1 capture in 8 (up to 3 in 8 in one session) fails outright even on a quiet host.
When it does, `transcript`, `headings` and `tableCells` collapse together — one fault presenting as
three, which is what made the probe look flaky in the first place. Those are refused by the dataset, so
they cost a retry and never become evidence.

That met the criterion set for the signal, so the probe is no longer suspected of measuring the wrong
thing. It stays **opt-in** for ordinary captures because five runs on ONE page with ONE worker is not
the corpus: promoting it to a default probe wants the same test across several table shapes and more
than one guest. The current table cases are the deliberate, bounded use of the signal.

Two fixes were needed, not one, and the second mattered more than the delta:

**The delta read.** `walkTable` reads a `spokenPhraseLog`
delta rather than `lastSpokenPhrase`. That was the wrong read all along: a single sample of a moving
target returns the *previous* phrase when the announcement has not landed (indistinguishable from
"did not move") or nothing (which the walk took for the end of the table). Priming, silence
tolerance and the settle were each compensating for that, which is why all three helped and none
cured it.

**And the degenerate capture.** The apparent instability was mostly not the table probe at all: two of
five captures had a transcript of exactly `["<document title>"]` with no headings and no cells, so
every field "varied" because the whole capture had failed. The caret was never in the document.
`readWithRetry` re-anchors and reads again when that happens. It is worth knowing what that did and did
not achieve, because the diagnostics were unambiguous: the retry fires (proven — it had silently never
fired when its condition tested for the bare title, and the real shape was the h1 announcement), but it
does **not** recover the common case. `afterStart.lastSpoken: ""` with every sweep reporting `found: 0`
after three round trips means NVDA answered every keystroke and never spoke — a mute screen reader,
which reading harder cannot fix. That is now detected and failed immediately, so the worker cold-starts
a fresh NVDA for the next capture instead of sweeping a silent one for ~45 s.

Two guards refuse what gets through, and they catch different shapes: `captureHasSubstance` for a
transcript that is only the title, and `captureIsSelfConsistent` for the nastier one — a transcript
announcing `heading, level 1` while the heading sweep found none. The second shape passes both the
title and substance checks, so without it a capture that never traversed the page would have been
written as evidence. Once those landed, the table probe was identical on every
run — the delta read had already fixed it, and the noise was coming from somewhere else.

The lesson is the familiar one: three fields varying together was one fault, not three. Reproduce with:

```bash
pnpm run training:repeat --url=http://<host>:5050/<table-case>/good --times=5 --probe-tables
```

It exits non-zero if any field varies. `tableCells` stays opt-in outside the table cases, and the
table signal remains presence-based so output-count variation cannot create a label.

## Not driven yet

Ordered by how much of a real user's experience is invisible without it. Every one names the
guidepup command that would do it, because that is the part that takes the digging.

| Gap | Why it matters | Route in |
|---|---|---|
| **Status messages / live regions**, NARROWED 2026-08-31 | This said we catch them "solely as a side effect of form submit". **Not so** — `probeKindFor` also activates a button the TASK names, and all 143 `4.1.3:form-activation-silent` cases use exactly that (`kind: taskButton`), so "notice how many results remain" is tested. The REAL gap is a live region triggered by something that is not a button: a link, a `<select>`, a checkbox. And widening it is bounded by policy, not by code — `probeForms` is off in the CLI because *pressing Book on a stranger's site is not a review* (`SECURITY.md`) | `activateAndCaptureDelta` already does the work; what needs deciding is WHICH controls it may reach, and that is a `SECURITY.md` question before it is a capture one |
| **Dialogs and modals** | Focus on open, focus *return* on close, whether Escape works, whether the background is still reachable. A focus trap here is the classic blocker. | activate a trigger, then `reportCurrentFocus`, `Escape`, `reportCurrentFocus` |
| **Arrow-key widgets** | Tabs, menus, radio groups, comboboxes, sliders. Their whole interaction model is arrow keys plus `aria-activedescendant`; we currently only ever *land* on them. | `moveToNextRadioButton` / `moveToNextComboBox` to land, then raw arrows |
| **iframes**, SWEEP BUILT 2026-08-31 | The sweep is written — `moveToNextFrame`/`moveToPreviousFrame` as a sixth `EXTRA_SWEEPS` entry, `anchorFirst` for the reason `lists` pays it: a frame CONTAINS what was swept before it, and quick-nav cannot find the container the caret stands inside. **Not yet active**: it needs a `CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bump to run, and that is deliberately bundled rather than spent on one sweep. **And it has no corpus case yet, deliberately** — a case needs a `badSignal` that discriminates named from unnamed, which needs to know what NVDA actually announces for each, which is a capture question. Guessing it is how a signal comes to fire on both variants | built; capture a frame, read the announcement, then write the case |
| **Language changes** | 3.1.2. NVDA switches synthesiser voice on `lang`; without it, foreign text is read as gibberish in the wrong voice. | needs synth-level observation, not a keystroke — hardest of these |
| **Typing feedback** | Live validation that fires while typing, and character echo. | `press` into a focused edit, diff the log |
| **SPA route changes**, NARROWED 2026-09-01 | This said the route-change probe was undriven. It is not: `probeRouteChange` already activates the first link, captures the announcement delta through `activateAndCaptureDelta`, and records title and first-heading before and after — which is exactly "activate a link, wait, diff the log". `2.4.2:route-title-stale` reads it and is a shipped rule. **Two things are genuinely missing.** `routeChange.announced` is recorded and read by NOTHING. And this row asserts the failure is 4.1.3 without support — 4.1.3 is about status messages that do NOT take focus, and a navigation does; getting that mapping right is the work, and building a rule on the row's own say-so is how the heading-hierarchy entry went wrong | settle the criterion first, then a rule may read `routeChange.announced` |
| **Reading order vs visual order** | 1.3.2. Needs the DOM/visual comparison that axe-core and the visual layer own — probably **not** ours. | out of scope, deliberately |
| **Focus visible** | 2.4.7 is visual. Belongs to the axe/visual layer, not the screen reader. | out of scope, deliberately |

### REFUTED 2026-08-30: heading hierarchy is not ours, and was never a WCAG failure

This table listed **heading hierarchy** as a gap, on the stated grounds that *"a skipped level (h2 → h4)
is a 1.3.1 failure that a flat heading list cannot show"*. The premise is wrong and the row is removed.

Read from axe-core's own rule metadata rather than from memory:

```
heading-order   "Heading levels should only increase by one"
                tags: ["cat.semantics", "best-practice"]      <- no wcag131, no wcag2a
```

**`best-practice`, not a WCAG tag.** WCAG 2.2 nowhere requires sequential heading levels; H42 asks that
headings be marked up as headings, and G141 asks for a logical structure. So a rule built on that row
would have fired on conformant pages for something no criterion requires — which is exactly the mistake
2.4.1 made before somebody read the Understanding page and found that a skip link is not required either.

And it is doubly not ours: axe-core already reports it, and this tool runs **alongside** axe-core rather
than instead of it. Duplicating a best-practice check from the rule layer is the one thing the division
in `CLAUDE.md`'s header exists to prevent.

**Worth knowing what IS there, because the evidence is real even though the finding is not.** NVDA
announces the level, `announcement.ts` parses it into `states` (`/^level \d+$/i`), and the corpus carries
6,846 `level 1` and 817 `level 2` announcements. Real pages go deeper — 121 / 355 / 76 / 29 across levels
1 to 4 — while the generator emits only `<h1>` and `<h2>` and never `<h3>`. So the data exists, nothing
reads it, and after this the correct answer is that nothing should.

## Two facts worth not rediscovering

**Jumping to a table lands on its caption, not in the grid.** `T` moves to the table element;
the caption is inside it but outside the cells, and NVDA answers every `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow` from
there with `"Not in a table cell"`. The first version of the table probe therefore collected
only the table's summary line — and read *identically* on a table with `<th>` and one without.
A probe that cannot discriminate is worse than no probe, because it looks like evidence.
`enterFirstCell` steps the caret down until a cell move lands.

**`nvda.perform(command)` and `nvda.press("Control+Alt+ArrowDown")` behave the same.** Worth
knowing because every quick-nav command that works here is a bare letter, so a modifier combo
is the natural suspect when a probe goes quiet. It was checked directly and it is not the
problem — both returned NVDA's identical "Not in a table cell". Do not spend the hour again.

## Adding a probe

1. New **fields only**. A probe and its dataset signal are coupled; changing an existing field
   silently blinds signals that read it (this has happened, to 8 cases at once).
2. Prove it **discriminates** — run it on a good page and a bad page and check the two differ.
   Identical output on both means you have built instrumentation that measures nothing.
3. Default it **off** if it costs real time **or if it is not yet deterministic**. Run it 5+
   times on ONE unchanged page and require identical output; `tableCells` failed that and is
   therefore opt-in. `captureOptions` in `server.mjs` is where that contract lives.
4. Compare against a previous capture's **evidence**, not its counts. A readiness gate once
   deleted every `"heading, level N"` announcement in the corpus while every count-based check
   stayed green.
5. It only runs against NVDA on the Windows worker, and there is no local test. Deploy, **reboot
   the guest** (a `utmctl exec` restart silently does nothing when the guest agent is not ready),
   confirm with `pnpm run worker:code`, then capture a real page and read the diagnostics.
