# Local accessibility model plan

## Recommendation

Do not train a general-purpose language model for `a11ign`. The project
already has a structured signal: an ordered NVDA transcript, structural
navigation results, and interaction deltas. The useful local model should be a
small discriminative scorer that answers questions such as:

> Does this captured evidence support WCAG 2.4.4 Link Purpose?

That model can score a candidate finding, but it cannot invent one. The existing
deterministic rules should continue to own exact absence cases such as an
unnamed control or missing image alternative. A report explanation can then be
rendered from the captured evidence and a fixed WCAG template.

The model's input boundary is the screen-reader output only:

- `transcript`: the ordered NVDA announcements from browse-mode reading;
- `structure`: announcements produced by heading, landmark, and form-field
  quick-navigation;
- `interaction`: announcements after activating a disclosure, submitting a
  form, or activating a task-named control, including empty announcement deltas;
- screen-reader identity and capture metadata, for reproducibility. The worker
  stamps its own versions into each capture; these provenance fields are not
  model features.

The page HTML, DOM, CSS, accessibility tree, axe results, URL, and source code
must not be model features. `task` may be passed to a separate task-completion
judgment, but it must not be used to decide whether the announced experience
violates a WCAG criterion. In other words, the good/bad HTML pages are only
controlled instruments for producing paired screen-reader captures and labels;
they are not the training input.

This is a much smaller and safer problem than training a generator, and it fits
the current `applyGate` seam in `src/spike/verify-gate.ts`.

## Model shape

The first local experiment should use
[`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
as a frozen text encoder, followed by one binary head per observable violation
subtype. Subtype scores are max-pooled into criterion scores, so a generic
missing-alt example does not have to share a decision boundary with a
filename-only or decorative-image example.
Its Hugging Face model page lists Apache-2.0 licensing, a 384-dimensional
embedding, and a `model.safetensors` file of about 90.9 MB. It also has ONNX
artifacts, which are a better inference format for this Node project than a
generative GGUF file.

The classifier input should be short evidence units rather than an entire page:

- one announcement or a small consecutive announcement window;
- one structural entry, such as a heading or form field;
- one interaction result, such as `control -> after`;
- the surrounding context needed for link purpose or heading quality.

The trained head receives two views of those units: the MiniLM embedding is
channel-tagged (`transcript`, `form-navigation`, `state-change`, and so on),
and a small fixed vector records relationships that are explicit in NVDA's
output. Examples include whether a field has a name before its role, whether a
data row includes a header before its column position, and whether an
interaction's announced state changed. These features never inspect HTML,
DOM, CSS, axe results, URL, or task text.

The model produces criterion scores. Rules, thresholds, and provenance produce
the final finding. A local generative model can remain an optional explainer,
but it should not be the only component deciding whether a WCAG failure exists.

`MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli` is a reasonable stronger
comparison model: its card lists MIT licensing and a safetensors checkpoint,
but it is about 0.2B parameters and is materially heavier. The official
`microsoft/deberta-v3-small` repository currently exposes `pytorch_model.bin`
and `tf_model.h5` rather than a safetensors checkpoint, so it does not meet the
project's training-weight policy without a separately verified conversion.

## Data collection

The data must be paired at the page/component level and then captured with the
same NVDA worker used in production. HTML alone is not enough: the target is
the assistive-technology experience, not just the DOM. Every training row must
be exportable from a capture fixture without opening the page source.

Use these sources in this order:

1. **Existing project fixtures.** They are the first seed set and already have
   capture-shaped JSON and ground truth. Keep them as a regression set even
   after exporting training examples. Export only `transcript`,
   `structure`, `interaction`, and capture metadata; do not export the fixture
   page HTML.
2. **W3C WAI tutorials.** Extend the existing fresh-authored good/bad pairs for
   images, forms, page structure, tables, menus, carousels, validation, and
   notifications.
3. **W3C ACT test cases.** The WAI test-case index currently describes 1,132
   cases with `passed`, `failed`, and `inapplicable` outcomes plus WCAG
   mappings. Use the rule metadata to select candidates, recapture the relevant
   cases with NVDA, and retain only the resulting screen-reader observations
   this project can actually make. Do not feed ACT HTML into this model.
4. **W3C BAD (Before and After Demonstration).** It provides paired versions of
   multiple pages plus evaluation reports. Capture both versions with NVDA and
   use the reports only to establish labels. It is useful for end-to-end sanity
   checks, but it should not be the only source because a model can overfit to
   a famous demo.
5. **WAI-ARIA APG examples.** Use the functional patterns as good seeds and
   create one controlled mutation at a time: remove a name, remove a heading
   role, stop updating `aria-expanded`, or remove a status announcement. Capture
   both variants and keep the source example and mutation identity only in
   provenance.
6. **A11YBench and AccessGuru.** These are not sources for this model. They may
   be useful for evaluating or improving the separate static HTML/DOM layer,
   but their checker violations are not screen-reader evidence and must not be
   turned into labels for the NVDA model.

Synthetic generation is appropriate for augmentation, not ground truth. A
template may remove one known attribute, capture the result with NVDA, and label
the resulting failure because the mutation is known. An unconstrained model
generating an entire page does not provide a reliable label. Keep generated
paraphrases separate from the hand-authored and standards-derived capture set.

## First local training run

The repository includes a deliberately small training path. It uses the pinned
`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` encoder as a frozen feature extractor
and trains one binary head per observable violation subtype. The subtype scores
are max-pooled to produce each criterion score. Both the base encoder and
the learned heads are handled as safetensors; the fetcher rejects pickle-style
checkpoint files and verifies the encoder SHA-256 before training.

Set up the optional Python environment on the Mac, then fetch the allowlisted
checkpoint and train from the exported screen-reader-only JSONL:

~~~sh
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r packages/scorer/requirements.txt
pnpm run training:fetch-encoder
pnpm run training:train
node packages/lab/scripts/verify-safetensors.mjs models/encoders/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
node packages/lab/scripts/verify-safetensors.mjs packages/scorer/models/screenreader-scorer
~~~

The learned artifact is `packages/scorer/models/screenreader-scorer/model.safetensors` and its
metrics/provenance are in `training-report.json`. The runner splits by page
family, never by transcript row, and rejects forbidden page-level fields. The
scorer combines channel-tagged evidence-unit embeddings with 29 structured
features derived only from screen-reader output:
heading-role gaps, named versus unnamed fields, associated versus position-only
table cells, announced state changes, status announcements, and other explicit
relations. High-confidence relations such as vague link names and unnamed form
fields have recorded feature multipliers in the training report. It trains
subtype heads and chooses criterion thresholds from grouped out-of-fold
predictions over the development families; the outer test families remain
untouched. The last diagnostic export contained 1,996 records. The source matrix
contains 1,061 pairs; 58 missing-landmark pairs remain in the structural/signal
layer because that absence is not reliably inferable from screen-reader output
alone. Under the current page/provenance guard, those older captures are stale
and the current export is intentionally empty until the matrix is recaptured.
The current report is not release-eligible: grouped calibration has one false
negative for 3.3.1, and the 4.1.2 unnamed-form-field subtype is still below its
minimum positive-development coverage. All 1,061 pairs must be recaptured before
training again. Existing acceptance captures are retained, but the
acceptance gate must be rerun against a release-eligible artifact rather than
treated as evidence for this diagnostic model.

The repeatable collection path is implemented in packages/lab/src/training/. pnpm run
training:generate creates 1,061 controlled good/bad page pairs across independent
content families (45 seed pairs, 128 initial independent variants, 627 bulk
variants, 36 targeted follow-ups, and 225 calibration variants).
pnpm run training:capture sends each pair through the existing interactive NVDA
worker, and pnpm run training:export emits JSONL only for pairs whose expected
contrast was actually heard by NVDA. The exporter keeps the page source as an
instrument and provenance, never as model input. It stops rather than
fabricating transcripts when no Windows/NVDA worker is available. It also
rejects captures whose page hash or provenance no longer matches the current
generated fixture, so stale evidence cannot silently become a label.
`pnpm run training:analyze-errors` then writes per-case reports for the selected
held-out split and grouped out-of-fold calibration, joining each scorer error to
its NVDA transcript, structured screen-reader evidence, and capture provenance.
This report is for diagnosis; it is not fed back into training as a label.

The untouched acceptance set is generated separately:

~~~sh
pnpm run training:generate-acceptance
pnpm run training:preflight-acceptance
DATASET_KIND=acceptance DATASET_ROOT=runs/screenreader-acceptance DATASET_PAGES_PORT=5051 DATASET_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5051 pnpm run training:capture
DATASET_ROOT=runs/screenreader-acceptance pnpm run training:check-signals
DATASET_ROOT=runs/screenreader-acceptance pnpm run training:export --out=runs/screenreader-acceptance/screenreader-evidence.jsonl
# Run the evaluator after the repeat exports below so stability is measured.
~~~

For capture-to-capture stability, repeat the acceptance capture into separate
namespaces and pass every exported JSONL file to the evaluator:

~~~sh
DATASET_KIND=acceptance DATASET_ROOT=runs/screenreader-acceptance DATASET_PAGES_PORT=5051 DATASET_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5051 DATASET_CAPTURE_ROOT=captures/repeat-1 pnpm run training:capture
DATASET_KIND=acceptance DATASET_ROOT=runs/screenreader-acceptance DATASET_PAGES_PORT=5051 DATASET_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5051 DATASET_CAPTURE_ROOT=captures/repeat-2 pnpm run training:capture
DATASET_ROOT=runs/screenreader-acceptance DATASET_CAPTURE_ROOT=captures/repeat-1 pnpm run training:export --out=runs/screenreader-acceptance/repeat-1.jsonl
DATASET_ROOT=runs/screenreader-acceptance DATASET_CAPTURE_ROOT=captures/repeat-2 pnpm run training:export --out=runs/screenreader-acceptance/repeat-2.jsonl
pnpm run training:evaluate-acceptance \
  --data runs/screenreader-acceptance/screenreader-evidence.jsonl \
  --data runs/screenreader-acceptance/repeat-1.jsonl \
  --data runs/screenreader-acceptance/repeat-2.jsonl
~~~

The normal capture path reuses NVDA for speed and discards a silent or not-ready
instance before retrying. To measure cold-start behaviour explicitly, set
`DATASET_REUSE_NVDA=0`; this is sent to the worker in the capture request. Setting
`A11Y_REUSE_NVDA=0` only on the Mac does not affect the Windows worker process.

## Verified inference and shadow mode

The release candidate is consumed through the checked-in scorer wrapper rather
than by importing the training script into the product. The wrapper verifies
the release gate, encoder SHA-256, representation schema, structured-feature
order, feature scaling, multipliers, and every safetensors head before it
scores anything:

~~~sh
pnpm run training:score \
  --data runs/screenreader-acceptance/screenreader-evidence.jsonl \
  --out /tmp/screenreader-scores.json

pnpm run training:shadow \
  --data runs/screenreader-acceptance/screenreader-evidence.jsonl \
  --out /tmp/screenreader-shadow.json
~~~

`pnpm run training:shadow` is score-only and explicitly log-only. To run the
same scorer beside the existing witness judge for a live capture, set
`A11Y_SHADOW_MODEL=1` on `pnpm run witness`. The existing judge and deterministic
rules remain authoritative; a scorer failure or ineligible artifact leaves the
current result unchanged.

`A11Y_SHADOW_PYTHON` chooses the interpreter the shadow run uses, falling back to `A11Y_PYTHON` and
then a bare `python3` on the `PATH` if neither is set — the same interpreter the real judge resolves to
by default, so a shadow run compares against the environment the real judge actually runs in unless you
deliberately point it elsewhere (a different venv, to check the scorer under a different torch/transformers
version without disturbing the one the judge uses).

`A11Y_SCORER_MODEL=<path>` points the scorer at a candidate model directory instead of the shipped
weights — read both by the shadow path above and by the real `local` judge backend itself, so setting it
runs the witness pipeline end to end against a candidate rather than the shipped model. Unset, it always
scores the shipped `packages/scorer/models/screenreader-scorer/`. Use it to see what a candidate under
training would actually report on a real page, before deciding whether to promote it.

Each score result records SHA-256 identities for the encoder, scorer weights,
training report, and exported training dataset. That provenance is the release
identity for an inference result; a filesystem path alone is not sufficient
because the model directory is mutable during development.

This artifact is intentionally NVDA-only. The score boundary rejects records
from another or unknown screen reader rather than implying that NVDA-trained
features generalise to VoiceOver, JAWS, or Orca; each new screen reader needs
its own captured and evaluated artifact.

Run the offline hardening gate before an integration change:

~~~sh
pnpm run training:hardening
~~~

It checks artifact integrity, family-disjoint acceptance data, per-criterion
held-out coverage, and prediction invariance under case-folding and harmless
whitespace changes. Its report is written to
`runs/screenreader-hardening.json`.

Capture provenance is stamped by the worker itself from its installed runtime:
NVDA, Edge, guidepup, Node, Windows, and the deployed worker-code hash. This is
deliberately not sourced from `DATASET_*_VERSION` environment variables, which
can silently become stale after a guest update. Existing captures predate this
field and therefore contain no exact version metadata; recapture them through
the worker before treating cross-version generalisation as complete.

## How much data is enough?

There is no responsible fixed number. The target depends on whether the model
is a frozen text encoder with a small classifier head, how many WCAG criteria
have separate heads, and how many independent page families are represented.
The current 1,061-pair source matrix is enough to evaluate a candidate, but it is
still below the recommended release-quality coverage band for several individual
criteria. Acceptance and repeatability are release gates, not permanent properties
of the matrix: rerun them after a capture-worker, NVDA, browser, encoder, or model
change and keep the artifact ineligible until they pass. Zero-error metrics from an
earlier iteration are evidence that that iteration was coherent, not proof that the
model will generalise to every site or NVDA version. Continue adding independent
content families and repeat captures as a monitored expansion, keeping the
acceptance set untouched.

Use these planning bands for the proposed frozen-encoder classifier:

| Stage | Per criterion | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Pipeline smoke test | 20–50 labeled captures | Exercise export, rules, and evaluation code |
| First useful baseline | 100–200 violation + 100–200 clean captures | Compare a linear head against deterministic rules |
| Candidate model | 300–500 violation + 300–500 clean captures | Measure whether the model generalizes across page families |
| Release-quality target | 500–1,000+ violation + 500–1,000+ clean captures | Support a multi-criterion model with a real held-out set |

For the current eight-criterion matrix, that makes roughly 1,600–8,000
criterion-labelled records, depending on how safely clean controls can be
shared between heads. This is where the earlier “thousands” estimate comes
from. It is a planning target, not a claim that the model needs exactly that
many rows.

Do not count repeated captures of the same page as independent examples.
Repeat captures are valuable for measuring NVDA/version stability, but the
training and test split must be grouped by page family, template, source, and
mutation. Hold out at least 20% of families, with roughly 30–50 independent
test examples per criterion before trusting a metric. Use a learning curve to
decide whether adding data still improves validation performance; the
scikit-learn learning-curve API is designed for this comparison:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/learning_curve.html.

The bookctx references and W3C sources supply the coverage taxonomy and
authoritative mutation patterns. ACT, BAD, and APG help us find candidate
pages; their HTML or checker results still need to be recaptured through NVDA
before they become evidence for this model. A11YBench and AccessGuru remain
outside this dataset because their static checker findings are not spoken
screen-reader output.

## Split and labeling rules

- Split by page template, topic, and source—not by individual transcript lines.
  A good and bad version of the same template must never be split across train
  and test.
- Start with one primary criterion per mutation. Put defensible secondary
  criteria in `allow`, as the current eval does.
- Keep page-source provenance and capture labels separate. The source page is
  useful for reproducing a capture, but the model-training record is the
  screen-reader evidence plus its independently justified label.
- Keep an untouched, human-reviewed holdout. Do not tune prompts, thresholds,
  or rules against it.
- Record the capture environment: NVDA version, browser version, worker commit,
  task, and capture options. Announcement strings are version-specific.
- Measure per-criterion recall, false positives on clean pages, macro F1, and
  test-retest variation. A single aggregate accuracy number will hide the
  important failure modes.

## Safe model handling

For training checkpoints, download only allowlisted safetensors and metadata,
pin a Hub revision, record the repository owner, license, revision, and SHA-256
hash, and reject pickle-style weights. Do not enable `trust_remote_code` for a
model that does not need custom code. A model page's verification indicator is
useful provenance, but it is not a substitute for checking the publisher,
license, revision, files, and hashes.

The repository includes `packages/lab/scripts/verify-safetensors.mjs` to enforce the local
file-format rule. A converted ONNX or GGUF inference artifact may be used only
after the training checkpoint has passed the training check and the converted
artifact is recorded separately.

## Acceptance bar before replacing the current judge

The local model should first run as an opt-in gate alongside the current judge.
It should replace a model-generated finding only when it meets the pre-registered
holdout bar for that criterion, with zero false positives on the clean paired
pages. Until then, the current judge remains the fallback and the local model is
an independently measured signal.
