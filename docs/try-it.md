# Try it in two hours

You already run an automated accessibility scanner in CI. This is a second layer that answers a different
question, and this page is the shortest honest path to finding out whether it is worth your time.

**We want your reaction, not a bug list.** If the output is not worth the minutes, that is the most
useful thing you can tell us, and it is the answer we have no other way of getting.

## What this finds that your scanner does not

Your scanner reads the markup. This drives **a real screen reader — NVDA, on Windows — through the page**
and records what it actually said.

That reaches failures markup cannot express, because they are about a *moment* rather than a state:

- a skip link that is present, correct-looking, and **inert**;
- a route change where the page updates and **the title does not**, so a screen reader user is told
  nothing about where they now are;
- a filter or form control that changes the page and **announces nothing**;
- a tab order that **contradicts the reading order** — the DOM has no reading order to contradict until
  something walks the page.

Every finding quotes the announcement it rests on. When we say a control is unnamed, the report shows you
the words NVDA spoke.

## What it will not do, stated up front

- **It does not replace your scanner.** It covers a handful of criteria deeply; yours covers many
  shallowly. Run both.
- **Most of what it reports is a referral, not an accusation.** The deterministic rules assert; the
  trained component only ever says *this is worth a person's look*. A referral on a page you believe is
  fine is expected behaviour, not a bug.
- **It needs Windows**, because NVDA is Windows-only. That is the real cost of the two hours.
- **Nothing is published to npm yet.** You install from the repository — [the commands are below](#the-other-route-run-it-from-the-repository), and `npx a11ign` will not work yet.

## The fastest route: a GitHub Actions run

If your app is on GitHub, this needs one workflow file and no machine of your own.

```yaml
name: a11ign

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  a11ign:
    runs-on: windows-2022        # NVDA is Windows-only; the action fails fast anywhere else
    timeout-minutes: 20          # a run that will not finish says so here, not after GitHub's own default
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write       # for the PR comment below; omit it and the report still runs, only quieter
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: a11ign/a11ign@v0.1.0
        # Pinned to v0.1.0, the first tagged release. Use the full 40-character commit SHA instead if
        # your CI must not move even across a release -- GitHub refuses an abbreviated one outright, it
        # does not just discourage it.
        id: a11ign
        with:
          url: https://your-site.example/the-page
          task: Send an enquiry
      # Keep the evidence: the rendered report and the full result, transcript included. Guarded on the
      # output existing, so a run that failed does not also fail the upload.
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always() && steps.a11ign.outputs.result-json != ''
        with:
          name: a11ign-result
          path: |
            ${{ steps.a11ign.outputs.result-json }}
            ${{ steps.a11ign.outputs.summary-md }}
          if-no-files-found: warn
```

Save it as `.github/workflows/a11ign.yml`. It runs on every pull request, and `workflow_dispatch` also lets you start it by hand from the repository's Actions tab (or `gh workflow run a11ign.yml`) — `workflow_dispatch` resolves the workflow from the default branch as GitHub sees it at dispatch time, so trigger it only after the push that changed the workflow has landed, not in the same breath as the push.

**Not on a pull request, no comment.** A run started by hand or by a push has nothing to comment on: the log's last line is the count (`a11ign: N finding(s)`), with a line before it for anything that bounds that count (an examination that ended early, a capture spanning more than one document, criteria resting on an examination known to be partial), and the report is in the `a11ign-result` artifact the upload step saves above — both the rendered report and the full result, transcript included. The same report is also written to the run's job summary, but a CLI-only reader has no route to that; the artifact is the one that works headlessly ([`docs/github-action.md`](./github-action.md#why-it-looks-like-this) has the reason and the `gh` commands).

**`task` is load-bearing, but the word match it enables is not the guard on what gets operated.** It is
what a user is trying to *do*, in plain words. On this shipped default (`probe-forms` on), a run always
expands disclosures and submits submit-like buttons, whatever the task says, and toggles checkboxes and
radio buttons with no task-word test either; it activates any OTHER button only if its announced name
shares a meaningful word with the task — so *"show only bags"* activates a **Bags** button and never a
**Delete account** one. Separately, `probe-navigation` (on everywhere by default) follows the first link on
the page, task or no task. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#it-operates-controls-on-the-page-and-one-probe-presses-buttons)
for the full rule and [the README's "Using it"](../README.md#using-it) for why a well-chosen task does not
also sharpen the verdict.

**Don't have a page picked yet?** Point it at `https://www.w3.org/WAI` — the W3C's own accessibility
site — for a first look before choosing anything of your own. We have already run it there
([`docs/github-action.md`](./github-action.md#tested-against-real-sites-in-the-wild)): 141 announcements,
and the same 3 findings on every measurement taken — axe-core's rule layer flags three `4.1.2` violations
inside the page's embedded YouTube player, none from the trained scorer — a real, reproducible result
rather than an untested placeholder. It is informational, with nothing to submit, so a `task` about learning something on the page (`"Learn about web accessibility"`) is enough. **The Action still operates controls on it, and the task word only gates one of them.** With the
defaults, a run against this exact page and task activated five controls: one button whose name happened
to share the word "Web" with the task, and — with no task-word test at all — three submissions of the
search form (landing on an empty query) and a followed link to a different page. On a site you do not own,
that is someone else's application being submitted to and navigated on your behalf. The CLI defaults
`probe-forms` off for exactly that reason; `probe-navigation`, which followed the link here, is on
everywhere by default and needs `--no-probe-navigation` to turn off — [see below](#the-other-route-run-it-from-the-repository).
**A run can leave the page you gave it entirely, and this one did** — the followed link above landed on a
second document, and the result says so itself: "THIS CAPTURE NAMED MORE THAN ONE DOCUMENT ... its
evidence was gathered across more than one page" is the tell. See
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#it-operates-controls-on-the-page-and-one-probe-presses-buttons) for the full
table of what a default run operates.

**Once you have seen real output, point it at the page with your contact form on it.** A long page with a
form exercises far more of this layer than a page of text alone — the form is where the announcements
this tool exists to hear actually happen.

<!-- WHY THE MARKERS BELOW EXIST (#1060): this page promised a floor and then cited two figures under
     it in the same sentence, calling them "within a few percent of each other" when the spread was
     seventy per cent. The markers make the checked population explicit. Nothing explanatory goes
     INSIDE them: a range named in a sentence about the old range is exactly what a text check cannot
     tell from the claim itself. Figures quoted outside the block are deliberately not held to the
     range, which is what lets the consent-banner failure be quoted as the failure it is. -->

<!-- TIMING:BEGIN -->

**Expect three to eight minutes for a real page.** Measured on eleven real-page runs (#311, #915): 3 m 14 s,
3 m 45 s, 4 m 14 s, 4 m 32 s, 4 m 38 s, 4 m 50 s, 5 m 48 s, 5 m 52 s, 6 m 35 s, 7 m 52 s and 7 m 54 s. **There
is a floor — the fastest run that reached the page was 3 m 14 s — and above it the spread is wide:** the
slowest of the eleven is 144 per cent longer than the fastest, so a simpler page does not reliably mean a
shorter run, and the range is a bound rather than a prediction for your page — and, per the runs below, not
a guaranteed lower bound either. Most of it is the screen reader reading, and that time is not
parallelisable or recoverable.

<!-- TIMING:END -->

**A run finishing well under four minutes is not necessarily a shorter examination — check the report
itself before reading speed as good news.** Two of the eleven are fast because they failed: `hubspot.com`
opened on a consent overlay Escape did not dismiss and read almost none of the page, on two separate runs
(4 m 50 s and, later, 3 m 45 s). The genuinely fastest of the eleven, `notion.com` at 3 m 14 s, completed
cleanly with 84 announcements and no overlay — so a fast run is not itself the tell; the report is. **Nor
is any figure above a guaranteed floor: a clean run on this exact page finished its capture-and-judge
step in 4 m 22 s** (run 34774692947, 2026-09-13), **its result byte-identical to a 5 m 08 s run the same
day** (34774183433); **a separate clean run elsewhere finished its capture alone, excluding judging, in
3 m 48.9 s, transcript byte-identical to a 4 m 44.7 s one** (runs 34782000257 and 34781484432). **So
duration alone does not tell you which happened — check the report itself:** if it shows almost nothing on
a page you know is large, you are looking at the banner (see the check below); a fast, full report is a
good run. **If a site redirects you to a regional page, pass that regional URL instead** — the tool refuses
a page it was not asked for, so a global homepage that redirects (`stripe.com` from the UK, for one) stops
within a minute with `wrong-page`; the regional URL it redirects to (`stripe.com/gb`) captures normally.
The range above has no ceiling of its own — the workflow's own limit on a run that will not finish at all
is stated below.

**Those are capture times, not the job you are billed for.** Setup comes on top. The two most recent jobs measured at a single build, both at `3bb1fddf` with warm caches (V1 rehearsal 4, runs 34781484432 and 34782000257, 2026-09-13), took 6 m 42 s and 5 m 56 s for the whole job. The only cold-cache job measured is older and at a different build, `0e809d13` (V1 rehearsal 1, run 34764686304, the same day): setup 85.3 s, capture and judging 7 m 30 s, and 9 m 20 s for the whole job. Budget runner time for the job, not the capture. The snippets above set `timeout-minutes: 20` on the job — a bit over twice the slowest one measured (9 m 20 s) — so a run that will not finish says so at 20, not after GitHub's own much longer job default.

**A run that does not finish looks nothing like a slow one.** Rehearsal 5's run 34799670660 (same commit, page and task as a run that had just succeeded) started its Action step and never completed it: the job ended after 50 m 01 s with GitHub's own annotation, "The hosted runner lost communication with the server" — not a11ign's. It left no log (`gh run view --log` answered "log not found"), no artifact, and a diagnostic step added with `if: always()` never ran either. **This says nothing about why**, or how often — that count is its own row ([#1520](https://github.com/a11ign/a11ign/issues/1520), still being measured: 1 lost of 12 runs so far whose Action step ran past 60 s). **What to do:** re-run the same commit. A single lost run like this one is evidence about GitHub's infrastructure that day, not about your page.

## The other route: run it from the repository

**Use this if your app is not on GitHub, or you want to see the output before you commit a workflow file.**
It is the same tool; the difference is where the Windows machine comes from. **`npx a11ign` does not work
yet** — nothing is published — so the package comes from a clone.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a11ign/a11ign.git
cd a11y-witness
npm install
npm run witness -- https://www.w3.org/WAI --task "Learn about web accessibility"
```

Node 20 or later. `npm install` builds the workspace, so there is no separate build step.

**The last command needs a capture worker and will not invent one.** A screen reader is a Windows desktop
application: there is no Docker image, and no flag substitutes for the machine. Run on a Mac or Linux box
with nothing configured, this is exactly what you get — quoted rather than paraphrased, because it is the
most likely first result and it is not a crash:

```
No capture worker answered at http://localhost:8765 (nothing was configured, so this address was a guess).
A screen reader is a Windows application, so nothing runs here without one. Set A11Y_WORKER to point at a
worker you have, or see docs/getting-started.md to set one up (~20 minutes with a Windows machine already,
or use the GitHub Action if you have none).
(connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765)
```

That last line is the reason the connection failed — `ECONNREFUSED` here, since nothing is listening; a
firewall or a different local setup will say something else.

**Three ways past it, cheapest first:**

| you have | do this |
|---|---|
| a GitHub repo | **[the Action above](#the-fastest-route-a-github-actions-run)** — a GitHub-hosted Windows runner is the worker, and you configure nothing |
| a Windows machine already | [`docs/getting-started.md`](./getting-started.md) — about twenty minutes, then `A11Y_WORKER=http://<that-machine>:8765` |
| neither | a Windows VM, 1.5–2 hours from scratch. **Take the Action instead** unless you specifically want the local path |

`npm run doctor` reports what this machine has and what each gap needs. It is read-only — it never starts
or stops anything — so it is safe to run before you have decided anything.

**`--probe-forms` is off here and on in the Action, and that is deliberate.** The CLI can be pointed at any
URL, and pressing *Send* on somebody else's production site is not a review. A workflow runs against your
own app, where submitting is intended.

## What a long marketing page will actually produce

Your page is one large page with many images, links and headings, and probably a contact form and a
consent banner. Here is what to expect from that shape, so nothing in the output is a surprise.

**Read the cookie banner warning first — it is the one thing that can waste the whole run.**

### The consent banner is the real risk, and you can check for it in ten seconds

**A screen reader that opens on a consent overlay can see the overlay and nothing else.** Measured on our
own test page: with the banner in the way, headings went 5 → 0, links 6 → 1, graphics 1 → 0. The page
simply vanished.

We handle it — the tool reads the page structure before anything can trap focus, and it presses Escape,
which dismisses most banners. **It does not always work.** On a batch of real public-sector pages, 24
captures opened on a consent overlay and never reached a heading. In one real run (#398) the page this
guide recommends pointing at — your own contact-form page — returned nothing but a consent-overlay
warning, after the full five minutes: the judgement was correct (it genuinely could not get past the
banner), but that is the worst-case shape the timing range above does not cover, and it is why the check
below matters more than the number.

**So check one thing before you judge the output:** if the report shows almost nothing — a handful of
elements on a page you know is large — you are looking at the banner, not at your site. Tell us; that is a
defect in our tool, not in your page. Running against a URL that skips the banner (a staging build, or a
page reached with the cookie already set) will also work.

### What is likely to appear, and which of it is a claim

| what your page has | what you may see | is it a claim? |
|---|---|---|
| Many images | **Missing alt text** (announced as unlabelled, or with an empty name), and **alt text that is a filename**: a camera name such as *IMG 4821*, or a name ending in an image extension, spoken (*photo dot jpg*) or written (*logo.png*) | **Yes — asserted.** Both are read directly from what the screen reader said. A generic placeholder name such as *thumbnail-image* is **not** a filename and is not flagged, so an image named that way still needs a person to look |
| *Learn more* / *Read more* links | Link purpose unclear from the text alone | **No — a referral.** It means *a person should look*, not *this is broken* |
| Unnamed graphics inside links or buttons | A control with no accessible name | **Yes — asserted**, when nothing names it |
| Headings | Heading structure, and whether headings and labels describe their content | Mixed — some asserted, some referred |
| A contact form | Error messages that are never announced; a status message nobody hears | **Only if you use the GitHub Action with a `task`** — see below |

**Referrals will outnumber assertions, and that is the design rather than hedging.** A referral on *learn
more* is the tool saying it cannot tell from the announcement alone whether the surrounding context makes
the link clear — which is exactly the judgement a person makes in a second and a scanner cannot make at
all.

**Zero of each is also a real answer, and the run does not let it read like a failed one.** A page with
nothing to flag — no missing alt text, no unnamed controls, nothing worth a referral — is a real, tested
outcome: it is how this project checks for over-flagging in the first place, scoring the W3C's own
accessibility site (a reference-quality accessible page) against an expectation of no findings at all. What
tells that apart from a run that never actually read your page is not the count, it is the shape of the
report. **A capture the tool doubts never gets to report a finding count.** With the GitHub Action, a
doubted capture replaces the usual summary entirely with **"a11ign — could not read this page,"** and the
job fails rather than passes, with its own reason on the log: *"the capture could not be confirmed to have
read the requested page; reporting no findings. This is a failed measurement, not a clean page."* Running
from the repository, the same doubt reaches you as a `WARNING` printed to stderr above a report that still
runs underneath it. So a report that runs normally — the usual heading, a non-zero announcement count,
findings and per-criterion outcomes both printed — and says `0 finding(s)` (the Action's own words for it:
**"No lived-experience findings. The screen-reader layer found nothing it could evidence"**) is a clean
read of your page. A "could not read this page" summary, a `WARNING`, or a job that failed instead of
finished is the tell that it was not — check
[the consent banner](#the-consent-banner-is-the-real-risk-and-you-can-check-for-it-in-ten-seconds) first.

### The contact form needs one thing from you

The command-line tool **never submits a form on a page it does not own** — pressing *Send* on somebody's
production site is not a review. The GitHub Action does, because you own the app, **and only when you give
it a `task`**. If you want the form assessed, say what a visitor is trying to do (*"Send an enquiry"*) and
point the run at the page with the form on it.

### How long a large page takes

**Expect three to eight minutes**, per the measurement above (#311, #915) — the floor is fixed regardless
of shape, because the time is a screen reader reading and that is not parallelisable or recoverable. The
range above it is not: the slowest measured run is 144 per cent longer than the fastest. A very large page can still exhaust our capture budget beyond that
range, and if it does you will get a partial result that **says** it is partial rather than a short one
that looks complete. The log adds a line above its count of findings,
`a11ign: N criteria rest on an examination known to be partial -- see the artifact`, and the job summary's
**Not determined** line counts those criteria apart. Which criteria, and why, is in the `a11ign-result`
artifact: each is `cantTell` in `outcomes`, and its `reason` names the sweep that fell short. A real run on
`https://www.w3.org/WAI` read *"The link sweep said it reached the end having found far less than the page's
census, so something held it, so this criterion rests on an examination known to be partial."* The
`conformance` block's reach line sets what the screen reader reached against what the browser exposes, type by
type. On a large page, open the artifact before you read a low count as a clean page.

## YOUR PAGE — the one section that is not written yet

**Everything above is the path for the shape of page you have: one large marketing page, many images and
links, a contact form, probably a consent banner. It is complete and you can follow it today.**

This section is deliberately blank, and it is the only part of this page that is. It gets filled in when
we have your URL, and it will hold three things nobody can write without it:

- **The exact workflow file for your page**, with your URL and the `task` a visitor on it is actually
  trying to do — not `Send an enquiry` as a placeholder, but the words that match a control on your page.
- **Whether your page has a consent banner in the way**, checked before you spend the minutes. This is
  the single thing most likely to waste the run, and it takes us one capture to answer.
- **What your run actually produced, read alongside you** — which findings are assertions, which are
  referrals, and which of the referrals were worth your attention. That last judgement is the one we are
  asking you for, and it is easier to make with somebody who can point at the announcement each one rests
  on.

**Why it is empty rather than filled with an example.** A worked example against a site we chose would
read as though the path had been walked, and it has not — not by anyone outside this project, which is
the entire point of #38. **An empty section that says what goes in it is honest; a plausible example is
not.**

**Nothing above depends on this.** If you would rather just run it, the GitHub Actions route needs your
URL and one line of `task`, and you will get a report.

## What we would like back

Four questions, and short answers are better than considered ones:

1. **Did the run see your page, or did it see the cookie banner?** The quickest tell is whether the
   element counts look like your page at all.
2. **Did you believe the findings?** For any you did not, the announcement is quoted — was the quote
   wrong, or was our reading of it wrong?
3. **Were the referrals worth reading, or noise?** They will outnumber the assertions. If *learn more*
   showing up thirty times is not useful, say so — that is a product decision we would rather make on
   your reaction than on our own taste.
4. **Was it worth the minutes it cost**, and did it tell you anything your existing scanner had not?

And, whenever it happens: **where did you get stuck?** Every question you had to ask us is a defect in
this page.

Open an issue, or reply to whoever sent you here. **A blunt "no" with a reason is worth more to us than a
polite yes.**

Your answers are recorded in [`outsider-runs.md`](./outsider-runs.md), in a fixed shape, in your own words
where you said them and `NOT STATED` where you did not.

## Things you may reasonably want to know

**Does it send anything anywhere?** No. The tool talks to the page you point it at and the machine running
it, and nothing else. No telemetry, no usage reporting, no call home, and no plan to add any.

**How accurate is it?**

<!-- CLAIM:BEGIN -- checked by public-claim.test.ts against a gate result recorded in
     docs/board/reported/, exactly as the README's claim block is. This figure lived here as a
     SECOND COPY for a while and went stale when the first one moved; that is why the markers exist. -->

**On our own corpus of 1,405 conformant records the deterministic rules asserted no failures.** The real-page figure is under re-measurement since 2026-09-06 and this page states none: a refreshed baseline produced four findings on pages an older baseline had passed, and until each is established as an assertion or a referral there is no honest number to give.

<!-- CLAIM:END -->

Both are measurements of pages **we** chose, not a claim about the web — which is exactly the gap your run
helps close. Your page is one we did not choose, which is the whole reason we are asking.

**Is it a conformance certificate?** No. It is evidence about specific criteria on specific pages.
