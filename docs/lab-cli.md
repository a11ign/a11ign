# The lab and fleet command line

Every long-running operation in this project — capture, export, training, calibration, the gates — runs on
one of two machines that are not this one: the **lab** (holds the corpus, the venv and the weights) and the
**fleet** (twelve Windows boxes that drive NVDA). This is the reference for reaching both.

**CLAUDE.md documents a command beside the problem it solves**, which is more useful than an index and is
where you should read first. This file is the other half: the complete surface, the parameters, and what
each command refuses. Nothing here is a second copy of a behaviour — where a command can describe itself,
this file tells you to ask it rather than restating an answer that could drift.

## The one rule

**There is no shell.** `ssh root@…`, `pct exec` and `scp` are not how this is operated, and were the source
of the four capture shards that ran against `--worker=http://:8765` for 29 minutes. A job is a **name** from
a fixed catalogue, dispatched with fixed argv that never goes through a shell, supervised by systemd, and
readable afterwards whether or not your connection survived. See ADR 0013.

That constraint is what every command below is shaped by: the things you would reach for a shell to do —
start something, watch it, read its output, fetch its report, stop it, clean up after it — each have a
command, because any one of them missing sends you back to the shell.

---

## Run something on the lab

```bash
npm run lab:job -- -e job=<name> [-e <param>=<value> …] [-e ref=<git-ref>]
npm run lab:job                                  # no job: refuses, and names every one it has
npm run lab:job -- -e job=<name> -e describe=1   # what this job runs, and what it takes
```

`-e ref=` runs the job at a named commit. It is **refused before anything expensive starts** if the ref is
not on `origin`, because the lab fetches from there — and `run-job.yml` refuses to run at a commit other
than the one asked for, since a job quietly running four commits behind reports success for code you did
not ask for.

### Parameters

A job takes only the parameters its own command reads, and the gate derives that from the command rather
than from a list beside it. **Ask the job:**

```bash
$ npm run lab:job -- -e job=capture-only -e describe=1
capture-only — reads only; REQUIRES only. Budget 3600s.
Runs /usr/bin/npm run training:capture -- --only={{ only }}
```

The published per-job names are `only`, `out`, `role`, `shard`, `model`, `worker` and `sample`.
`train` also takes `exclude` (#2304): `-e exclude=status-heads -e out=scratch` leaves a NAMED GROUP of heads out
of one run, for an isolating retrain. The groups are a fixed list in `lab-job.yml` (`lab_train_exclusions`),
`out` is required and may not be `candidate`, and the model it writes is stamped `releaseEligible: false` with
`excludedSubtypes` in its `training-report.json`, so it cannot be promoted or mistaken for a full one.
It does not change who decides a subtype: that is still `rule-ownership.json`. Two apply
to **every** job and so sit outside that check: `-e ref=` and `-e describe=1`. Two refusals follow from the
derivation, and both replace a silence:

| you did | what used to happen | what happens now |
|---|---|---|
| passed a parameter the job ignores | Ansible discarded it without a word, the job ran its default, and you believed your value was applied | refused, naming what the job does read |
| omitted one the job cannot run without | it rendered as an empty string — `capture-only` with an empty `--only=` captures the **whole corpus** | refused, naming the parameter |

Values are **enums and names, never paths**: `-e out=candidate` resolves against a fixed root and
`-e worker=` is a name from `inventory.yml` turned into an address, so `runs/../../etc/cron.d/x` is
*inexpressible* rather than rejected. `ProtectSystem=strict` enforces the same thing at the kernel.

**A job of a given name is refused while one is running** — the unit name is the lock, and it holds against
any other route to the box, which an in-process flag could not.

### The catalogue

36 jobs. `npm run lab:job` with no arguments prints the current list; these are the groups.

| | |
|---|---|
| **capture** | `capture`, `capture-only`, `capture-real-pages`, `capture-acceptance`, `capture-acceptance-2`, `generate-acceptance` |
| **export** | `export`, `export-acceptance`, `export-test`, `build-realism` |
| **train and promote** | `train`, `retrain`, `promote`, `promote-diff`, `everything` |
| **gates** | `release-gate`, `rules-gate`, `rules-coverage`, `rules-real-pages`, `rules-real-pages-update`, `check-signals`, `stability`, `acceptance`, `acceptance-shipped`, `acceptance-shipped-copy`, `python-tests` |
| **audits** | `grants-audit`, `applicability-audit`, `container-exits`, `starvation`, `shortcuts`, `shortcuts-baseline`, `false-positives`, `sweep` |
| **diagnostics** | `inventory`, `evidence-check` |

## Watch it, read it, stop it

```bash
npm run lab:status                      # every a11y-job-* unit and its state
npm run lab:status -- -e job=<name>     # systemd's view + the journal + the run's own progress file
npm run lab:log    -- -e job=<name>     # the job's OWN OUTPUT, unwrapped — bytes, not YAML
npm run lab:fetch  -- -e artifact=<name> [-e out=<model>]   # a report, as a file
npm run lab:stop   -- -e job=<name>     # end one deliberately; reports what it discards first
npm run lab:reset  [-e ref=<git-ref>] [-e remove=<path>]    # unblock a pull the lab's own output blocks
```

**`lab:status` is the authoritative source, and hand-rolling `journalctl` instead of running it is itself a
defect source** — three of the six misreads recorded in CLAUDE.md came from exactly that. It bounds the
journal by `InvocationID`, so it shows **one run** rather than the unit's whole history; a hand-written
`--since` window spans two runs and hands you the previous one's verdict.

**`lab:log` is for output you need to read rather than scan.** `lab:status` shows the journal through
Ansible's `debug`, which wraps at ~90 characters and re-quotes as YAML, so a table, a transcript or a
threshold sweep arrives as fragments.

**`lab:fetch` artifacts** are a fixed list, for the same containment reason as job parameters:
`abstention-sweep`, `acceptance-records`, `acceptance-report`, `capture-progress`, `false-positives`,
`grants-audit`, `promoted-acceptance-report`, `promoted-training-report`, `promoted-weights`,
`shipped-acceptance`, `shortcuts-baseline`, `training-report`.

**A job name that is not in the catalogue is refused by all three**, and says so. Until 2026-08-26
`lab:status -e job=<typo>` answered `SubState=dead` and **exit 0** — which is what a finished job answers,
so a script polling a mistyped name read it as fine. `lab:log` blamed a rotated journal and `lab:stop` said
there was nothing to stop. Three commands, one collapsed answer; each now names the actual cause.

**`lab:stop` refuses a unit that is not running** and names the state it found instead — "it was already
finished" and "I stopped your job" are different outcomes. It exists because the unit name is the lock, so
`lab:job` refuses a second job of that name, and until it was written the only way out was `systemctl stop`
over ssh: the exact hole ADR 0013 closed.

**`lab:reset` discards only what `origin` already has.** The lab writes tracked files (promoted weights, a
shortcuts baseline), which dirty the checkout and block the next `git pull`. Anything it will not discard
it **reports** rather than aborting on, and `-e remove=<path>` is the deliberate escape hatch.

---

## Run several in order

```bash
npm run lab:pipeline -- --list
npm run lab:pipeline -- --pipeline=<name> [--ref=<git-ref>] [--only=<case-ids>]
```

| pipeline | fleet? | what |
|---|---|---|
| `gates` | no | score every gate against the corpus already on disk — minutes |
| `recalibrate` | no | re-derive and re-gate the model from the dataset on disk — no capture, no export |
| `verify` | yes | capture one subtype (`--only=`) and re-run the audits that would see the change |
| `real-pages` | yes | recapture the real-page corpus and prove no conformant page gained a finding |
| `corpus` | yes | recapture the synthetic corpus, then score the rule layer against it |
| `candidate` | yes | re-export both corpora under the current parse, train, audit, promote |
| `full` | yes | corpus, model and gates in one run — the whole thing, proven together |

The **order** is the thing this adds; every stage already existed and was supervised, but the sequence lived
in somebody's head. Retyped by hand it produced a fleet deployed at `main` while the lab ran a branch, four
boxes rebooted for an unpushed ref, and three jobs run four commits behind.

- **One ref, resolved once and given to both halves.** `fleet:deploy` and `lab:job` default independently,
  which is exactly how they came to be on different commits — failing with a hash mismatch that reads like
  a corrupted checkout. It is refused up front if it is not on `origin`.
- **It stops at the first failing stage and names what did not run.** A pipeline that continues past a
  failed gate produces a number that looks exactly like a good one.
- **`--only=` reaches the stage that reads it and no other.** Forwarding it to every stage is the same
  defect as a parameter a job silently ignores.

`verify` is the modular path: fix something, capture only the cases it affects, re-run the audits that
could see the change. It shares its mechanics — and its captures, which are cache-keyed identically — with
the full run, so nothing it produces is thrown away when you commit to `full`.

---

## The fleet

```bash
npm run fleet:status                    # what every box is doing, right now
npm run fleet:deploy                    # pull + install + restart + PROVE it
npm run fleet:provision [--serial=0]    # the ROLE: NVDA, the Edge pin, policies, the provision stamp
npm run worker:code                     # each worker's /health.code vs this checkout
eval "$(npm run --silent fleet:env)"    # A11Y_WORKERS from inventory.yml
npm run fleet:sleep / fleet:wake / fleet:tailscale / fleet:normalise / fleet:discover
```

The fleet is defined **once**, in `inventory.yml`. Three things are worth knowing before you type any of
these, and each has cost a run:

- **`fleet:provision` must run across the WHOLE fleet.** `provisionRevision` is a capture cache key *and* a
  `MUST_MATCH` consistency field, so a box provisioned alone gets a stamp its peers lack, the fleet reads
  INCONSISTENT, and every capture refuses to start. `--serial=0` is the normal way to converge one:
  10 m 07 s across five boxes against 26 minutes serial. Use `--limit` only to **repair** a box back to the
  stamp its peers already carry.
- **`fleet:deploy` is for bare metal; `worker:deploy` is for local UTM VMs.** They are not
  interchangeable — `worker:deploy` is `utmctl file push`, takes a VM UUID rather than a host, and fails
  immediately off macOS.
- **`fleet:status` finds the fault that produces zero failures.** A degraded guest's own retry absorbs
  every recovery, so `failures` stays 0 while that box runs at three times its neighbours' cost.

A capture **refuses a fleet that is not running this checkout**, at both capture entry points.
`--allow-stale-workers` overrides it and says so in the output rather than passing quietly.

---

## A flag a command does not read is refused, not ignored

Every CLI here parses argv by looking for the flags it knows, so anything else is dropped without a word
and the command runs its default. This repo has paid for that twice — a blocker's own message told the
reader to run `--write-baseline` when the flag is `--update-baseline`, and `--only=route-title-stale`
covered 1 of that family's 7 cases. Neither produced an error; both produced a plausible wrong answer.

```
$ npm run lab:pipeline -- --pipeline=gates --refs=main
  npm run lab:pipeline: unknown flag --refs — did you mean --ref?
  It takes: --list --only --pipeline --ref
  Refusing rather than ignoring it: an ignored flag runs the default and reports success.
```

Guarded so far — eleven: `training:capture`, `capture-real-pages`, `lab:pipeline`, `promote:model`,
`training:check-signals`, `training:repeat`, `training:wait`, and the `--json` reporters `doctor`,
`fleet:status`, `training:status`, `lab:inventory`. `promote:model` is the sharpest of them: a mistyped
`--dry-run` **promotes**.

The rest are listed in `cli-flags.test.ts` as `UNGUARDED`, **a list that may only shrink** — a new CLI
that is neither guarded nor on it fails that test, so the gap stays countable rather than invisible.

## Exit codes and what refuses what

`lab:job`, `lab:status`, `lab:log`, `lab:fetch`, `lab:stop` and `lab:reset` are Ansible playbooks: **0** the
play succeeded, **2** a task failed — which includes every refusal above. `lab:pipeline` exits **0** on a
clean run, **2** on a refused or failed stage, and names the stage.

**Never pipe a command whose exit status you intend to read.** `npm run lab:pipeline … | tail` reports
`tail`'s status, and a real `ANSIBLE_EXIT=2` has read as success here twice. Redirect to a file, then read
both the file and the status:

```bash
npm run lab:pipeline -- --pipeline=gates > /tmp/gates.log 2>&1; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

And **read the echoed value** — appending `; echo "EXIT=$?"` makes the compound command's status the
echo's, which is always 0. Measured 2026-08-25: a pipeline failed at stage 5 and the wrapper reported the
run as exit 0, because the shell's last statement had succeeded.

## Incidents moved from CLAUDE.md (#458)

### What state is the CORPUS in — `lab:inventory`

```bash
npm run lab:job -- -e job=inventory     # the authoritative answer, on the box that holds the corpus
npm run lab:inventory                   # against a local copy; it SAYS it is a copy
npm run lab:inventory -- --json
```

Every other moving part had a status command — `fleet:status` for the boxes, `lab:status` for a job,
`doctor` for the local environment, `worker:code` for what the guests run. The corpus and the artefacts
trained from it had none, and they are what everything else exists to produce. So those questions were
answered by opening an SSH shell and running ad-hoc Python — **about eight times on 2026-08-25**, one of
which read the wrong field and reported `captured: 0` while `lab:status` correctly said 85. A one-off
script has no tests, no review and no second reader.

It answers four questions, each of which has cost a run:

| | |
|---|---|
| **is the corpus homogeneous?** | the distribution of every cache-key field, with COUNTS — "split" and "split 3,168 to 42" distinguish a finished migration from a run that died halfway. An ABSENT field is counted as a value, because the key reads it as `unknown` and those captures can never match a live guest |
| **are the exports current?** | measured against the CAPTURES each was built from, not against the clock. The featurizer reads a `parsed` block baked in at export time, so an announcement-grammar change moves the model input without touching a line of Python |
| **what schema is each model stamped with?** | read from safetensors metadata, not `training-report.json`, which does not carry it |
| **is a schema migration open?** | what `release:gate` refuses on, and which candidate could close it |

**It reports WHERE it read from, because it lied on its first run.** From a laptop it said *"NO candidate
carries it yet"* — true locally, false on the lab, which held a v15 candidate. `runs/` is gitignored, so a
local copy is only as fresh as its last sync and carries no `runs/model-*` at all. "None here" and "none
anywhere" are different answers, and it now refuses to turn the first into the second.

**NVDA records almost nothing by default** — a whole session log is seven lines, identical on a healthy
guest and a failing one. `A11Y_NVDA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` raises it (applied to `nvda.ini` at boot, no
elevation needed). Opt-in, because NVDA writes a great deal at DEBUG and this pipeline measures
per-capture timing.

**Comparing two guests:** `npm run worker:compare -- <page> <worker> <worker> [--rounds=7]`. Interleaved
round-robin with medians and IQRs, and it refuses to declare a difference the samples do not support.
Use it instead of reading two `bench-capture` printouts — that is how a 2x difference got attributed to
the wrong phase for hours.

**Backing up the corpus — THREE STEPS, and each verifies the one before by reading it back.** `runs/` is
gitignored, so thousands of captures and 54 measured worker-hours exist in one place, and they are NOT
reproducible: `browserVersion` is a cache key precisely because Edge announces differently across
releases, so evidence taken under Edge 151 cannot be recreated now 152 ships.

```bash
npm run lab:job -- -e job=corpus-snapshot        # archive ON THE LAB, beside the corpus
npm run lab:fetch -- -e artifact=corpus-archive  # bring the newest one to the control plane
npm run corpus:release -- --archive=runs/fetched/<name>.tar.gz   # upload, then DOWNLOAD IT BACK
npm run corpus:release -- --verify=corpus-<stamp>               # is an old release still restorable
```

**The transport is two hops because of CREDENTIALS.** The lab is the machine the corpus lives on, so a
GitHub token there sits next to the thing it protects — and surviving the loss of that machine is the
whole point. The token stays on the control plane, which already has one, and the archive travels.

**Every step distrusts the one before, and each caught something real.** `corpus:snapshot` lists its own
archive with `tar -tzf` and refuses on a shortfall, because `tar` exits 0 on a short archive — a 417 MB
snapshot once extracted to 4,959 of 5,445 JSON files with no error anywhere. `corpus:release` downloads
the asset back over the public API rather than trusting `gh release upload`'s exit code, because the API
accepting bytes is not the asset being complete and readable a month from now, which is the only property
a backup has. **A verification sharing a failure mode with the action verifies nothing** — the same rule
as checking `/health.code` over HTTP rather than through the deploy channel.

`corpus:backup` remains for an `rsync`/mounted-volume destination via `A11Y_CORPUS_REMOTE`, with
`corpus-backup-verify` as its read-back. It **exits non-zero with no destination configured** rather than
writing a local archive and reporting success: a backup tool that claims success while leaving one copy on
one disk converts a known risk into an assumed safety.

## Make the failure bubble up, or you will dig for it every time

Three commands answer "what happened", and the third was missing for months:

```bash
npm run lab:status -- -e job=<name>   # systemd's view, the journal, and the run's own progress file
npm run lab:log -- -e job=<name>      # the job's OWN OUTPUT, unwrapped — bytes, not YAML
npm run lab:fetch -- -e artifact=<name>   # a report, as a file
npm run lab:reset                         # what is dirty in the lab checkout, and is it safe to discard
npm run lab:reset -- -e apply=true        # discard it — ONLY files origin already has
```

**`lab:reset` exists because promoting leaves the lab dirty and every later job then refuses to pull.**
`promote:gated` runs there (it is the only box with both the candidate weights and the code) and
deliberately does not commit, since promoting is a MAJOR release. `run-job.yml` then declines to pull into
a dirty checkout — correctly, it cannot tell a stray artefact from work in progress — so the next job runs
at the pre-promotion commit and the `gates` pipeline fails at stage 1 saying so.

**`npm run lab:collect-promotion` does this whole dance, and exists because the paragraph below is a
procedure a human has to remember.** It fetches all four promoted artefacts, reads the changeset's real
name OFF THE LAB rather than guessing it, installs them, and runs `scorer:verify` and `release:provenance`
on the result — the one check that can see weights and a changeset describing different models, which it
found on 2026-09-01 (tree at 2,525 records, lab at 2,607). It does not commit, push or clear the lab;
those are the deliberate steps and it prints the exact commands. Measured cost of not having it: three
round trips on 2026-08-30 and four more on 2026-09-01, both times over the changeset's NAME.

**KEEP THE NAME `promote:model` GAVE THE CHANGESET.** It names the file after the candidate it promoted
(`promote-candidate-<hash>.md`), and the natural thing after `lab:fetch -e artifact=promoted-changeset` is
to commit it under a name that means something to you. Do that and the LAB's copy stays untracked at a
path origin does not have, so `run-job.yml` refuses every later job — *"the checkout is dirty, so it was
left alone"* — and `lab:reset` will not touch it, because it deliberately never discards untracked work.
Measured 2026-08-30: three round trips, and `-e remove=` refused it too (*"neither untracked nor a tracked
modification"*). Renaming the committed file to match the lab's fixed it at once. Two names for one
artefact is the fact-stated-twice shape in its cheapest form.

It **refuses anything origin does not already have**, comparing each dirty path against `origin/<ref>`
before touching it, and reports without applying unless `-e apply=true`. That containment is not decorum:
the manual alternative is `git checkout --`, the command that once destroyed release-eligible weights in
this repo. Untracked files are never discarded, and it says so rather than reporting a clean checkout.

**`lab:log` exists because reading one audit's output took eleven hand-written `awk | sed | grep`
pipelines in a single session, one of which silently matched nothing.** `lab:status` shows the journal
through Ansible's `debug`, which wraps at ~90 characters, re-indents and quotes as YAML — so a table, a
transcript or a threshold sweep arrives as fragments. The journal is now written to a file on the lab and
fetched. That is the same remedy `lab-fetch.yml` already applied to reports, and improvising around it
rather than reading it is itself the defect this file names.

Three rules that follow, each of which cost a round trip on 2026-08-25:

- **A report that exists only as stdout is one a job runner can lose.** `audit_grants.py` exited 1 with a
  real finding and its journal read `-- No entries --`. Write the report to `runs/` and make it fetchable.
- **Two different faults must not print the same word.** That audit reported `FAIL vague-link 0/52` for a
  declaration naming a feature the pipeline no longer computes — nothing wrong with those 52 pages —
  beside `FAIL fake-heading 35/48`, which is real missing evidence. They need opposite fixes and one of
  them is not in the corpus at all. It now prints `STALE` and says why.
- **A count is where an investigation stops.** "13 records lack it" sent me theorising twice. The report
  now carries the TRANSCRIPT of up to three failing records, and the answer was visible in one line of it:
  `"out of table, Borrowing books"` — NVDA's container-exit prefix, which the relation rejects as a role.

### The order that would have saved the evening: AUDIT FIRST, THEN FIX

Every wrong turn on 2026-08-25 came from reasoning about a MECHANISM instead of measuring the EVIDENCE,
and every recovery came from an audit that asked "is this actually true?" over the whole corpus.

| what I reasoned | what the audit said |
|---|---|
| `plain_heading_candidate` separates perfectly — 5 of 5 held-out positives carry it | it misses **13 of 108** on the full corpus; five positives cannot see a 12% miss rate |
| `probeTables: false` on 62 cases means the table evidence was never captured | `table_position_only` reads the TRANSCRIPT — **49 of 49 carry it**, the corpus was fine and my check was wrong |
| 52 `vague-link` records are missing evidence | the feature was deleted this morning; the DECLARATION is stale |

Two of those three would have led to a full recapture of 62 cases for nothing. **Write the check that
would detect the problem, run it to confirm the problem is what you think, then fix, then re-run.** Doing
it the other way round cost two reverts and most of an evening.


## DATASET_BASE_URL, the full computation

- `DATASET_BASE_URL` — overrides the computed page-server URL outright, full origin and all
  (`http://host:port`, no trailing slash). `hostPagesBase()` normally works this out itself: a real LAN
  address for a remote fleet worker (a worker cannot reach `localhost` — that resolves to *itself*, not
  the host serving pages) and a plain `localhost` when the worker and the page server are the same
  machine. Set this when that computation is wrong for your network — no interface shares the worker's
  subnet, or you are tunnelling through something the address guess cannot see — and `hostPagesBase`
  says so in its own error when it cannot work it out and this is unset.
