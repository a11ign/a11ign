# The daily board report

**The report is published by GitHub Actions, not from anyone's machine.**

| workflow | when | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `board-report.yml` | 08:13 London daily | posts the engineering edition to the report issue and the board edition as a Discussion in **Board editions** |
| `board-summary-check.yml` | 20:00 UTC daily | comments once if tomorrow's executive summary is not committed. It writes no summary text |

**The stated hour is true year round, and it costs two crons to be so.** GitHub schedules in UTC only, so
one cron is the right London hour for half the year and an hour out for the other half. **Both are
scheduled and every working step is gated on London's actual clock**, so exactly one of the pair acts on
any given day. The off-hour run does nothing, says so in its log, and **exits successfully** — a job that
failed daily for behaving correctly would put a red mark on the repository every morning, and a signal
that is red every day is a signal nobody reads.

A stated time that is wrong for half the year is the same small untruth this pipeline refuses everywhere
else. `board-schedule.test.ts` pins the pair and the gate together, because they are two facts that must
agree: move the publish time and it is the second one you forget, and the failure is silent — the job
simply never runs.

## The edition is a Discussion, and its category is a MANUAL prerequisite

**Since #1290 the board edition is a Discussion in the `Board editions` category (slug `board-editions`),
one per date, titled `Board report — <date>`.** A republish updates that post in place and never adds a
second one. Until 2026-09-13 it was a PDF on a draft release — and a draft release creates no tag, is
visible only to write-access accounts, and does not travel with a repository transfer. The words did not
change; `board-document.mjs` still produces them.

**The category is created by hand, and nothing can create it for you.** GitHub has no API mutation for a
Discussion category — it is a click in the repository's Discussions settings, by an admin — and categories
do not travel with a transfer either. **On any new repository, create "Board editions" before the first
08:00 run.** Without it the publish step refuses and posts nothing. It never falls back to General, because
an edition published into the wrong category looks exactly like success.

The category is resolved **by slug on every run**, never by id: an id is per-repository and changes when
the category is created again.

**The PDF is an optional flag, for a day a file is wanted** — `pnpm run board:document --pdf`, with
`--release` beside it still attaching it to a draft release. The scheduled job uses neither, and its token
has `contents: read`, so it cannot create a release draft even if somebody re-adds the flag.

```bash
bash scripts/fetch-board-report.sh 2026-09-06 # an edition's PDF from the days it was a draft release
```

## THE LAUNCHD JOB IS RETIRED, and the reason it existed is worth keeping

It ran on one Mac, and the argument for that was **not** convenience: the report's merge count and
push-state lines exist to catch work committed locally and never pushed, and a GitHub runner only ever
sees `origin/main`. A scheduled report confidently wrong about the thing it was built to see is worse
than a manual one.

**The chairman's ruling that everything is pushed removes the premise.** GitHub is then the complete
record, and the schedule stops living on a single machine nobody else can see, restart or inherit — which
was a real single point of failure, and one this project had already written down under a different
heading.

**What the ruling costs, stated rather than absorbed:** this workflow *cannot* detect an unpushed local
branch, so it cannot report one. The push-state line now records the rule rather than proving it, and
says so in the edition itself. The dispatcher's own branch count is what would contradict it, and a
branch found unpushed appears in the report as an exception. **An absent check must not read as a clean
one.**

## Where a rendered PDF goes, and why not beside the log

**`~/Documents/a11y-witness-board-reports/<date>.pdf`, one file per date**, on a day one is rendered. The
Discussion is the edition; the PDF is a copy.

It was written beside the scheduled job's log for a while, on the reasoning that a LaunchAgent's output
belongs in `~/Library/Logs` on macOS. **That reasoning was about the log.** A board document is not a log:
it is a deliverable a person opens, and a deliverable filed where its reader does not look has not been
delivered. The log stays there, where the original reasoning does hold.

**The intermediate HTML is written to a temporary directory, not to that folder.** It is Chrome's input
rather than a deliverable, and *one file per date* means one file — a folder holding two files a day, one
of which opens as unstyled markup, is a folder somebody has to learn to read past.

## Why it cannot run on a GitHub runner

A runner only ever sees `origin/main`. Two of the report's lines exist specifically to catch a push hold —
the merge count and the push-state line — and on a runner the first would miss anything merged locally and
unpushed, while the second would read *"level, checked"* every day whether or not it was true.

**A scheduled report that is confidently wrong about the thing it was built to see is worse than a manual
one.** So this runs from a checkout that can see local branches, which for now means the control-plane
machine. That is a contingency to know about: if this machine stops being the control plane, the report stops
with it, and issue #20's body says a missing edition is a defect in this process rather than a quiet period.

## What refuses, and what it refuses to do

`--post` will **not publish** unless the files the report reads out of the working tree match `main`:

```
docs/board/reported/      the gate result and the fleet-hours total
scripts/board-report.mjs      the generator itself
```

Two states both refuse, and they are different: **uncommitted** changes, and **committed on another branch**
— the scheduled job runs from whatever branch this checkout is sitting on, and a peer's branch is not dirty
while still supplying a `reported.json` nobody reviewed.

It exits **3**, says which files and which state, and **publishes nothing** — never a partial edition. The
wrapper writes that verdict into the log with its reason, so a missing edition can be explained rather than
guessed at.

`--allow-dirty-read-set` overrides it and **stamps the published edition** with the fact, rather than
overriding quietly.

**This is deliberately not "refuse if `git status` is non-empty".** Several agents work in this checkout at
once, and a guard that fires on somebody else's unrelated edit is one people disable within a day — the same
reasoning `promote:model` uses when it checks its target paths rather than the whole tree. Everything else
the report reads is a ref or the GitHub API, and neither is affected by an uncommitted file.

## Knowing a failure mode does not protect you from it; only a check that runs does

Two things happened within an hour of `pnpm run mutate` being built **by the person who then did them**,
and they are the two halves of this repository's oldest defect. They are here rather than in a commit
message because the next person building a generator will open this file, not that commit.

**An edit that matched nothing and reported success.** A scripted replacement whose anchor was indented
four spaces inside a function while the pattern used two. Python replaced nothing, exited zero, and the
change was announced as done. It was caught only because the render afterwards went to the old path —
that is, by the *behaviour* disagreeing, not by anything checking. **Assert the anchor before writing**,
so a pattern that matches nothing fails loudly:

```python
assert old in s, "ANCHOR NOT FOUND -- refusing a no-op edit"
```

**A check whose answer was ignored.** Two files were compared before deleting one; the comparison printed
`DIFFER — leaving both`, and the delete ran anyway, because the check and the action had been written as
two separate commands rather than one gating the other. Nothing was lost that time. **Gate the action on
the check** — `cmp -s a b && rm a` — because a check whose result nothing consumes is decoration.

**Use `pnpm run mutate` even where it feels like overhead.** It refuses a mutation that changed nothing,
which is the first of these exactly; and it runs the test again after restoring, which is the discipline
of the second. Both of the above were done by hand, going round the outside of a tool built that hour to
catch them.

## Recording a result the report cannot compute

`reported.json` is the only place it takes a number it cannot read from GitHub or git, and **both entry
shapes are documented inside that file** so they are read at the moment a result is recorded, not recalled
from a message.

- A **gate** entry carries the gate's own text verbatim. The newest by `at` is printed; one older than
  `staleAfterHours` still prints, marked `STALE` — an absent line and an old line are different facts.
- A **fleet-hours** entry must name the `run` it was computed from. Without one the report prints
  **REFUSED** and says what is missing, rather than printing the total with a footnote. A footnote is
  something a reader skips; a refusal is not, and unlike a convention it cannot be satisfied by remembering.
- An **achievement** stays in the body for at most **three editions** and is then marked `inBody: false`,
  so **section 3 lists the achievements of the last three editions and the appendix lists all of them** —
  the two-page cap is met by a rule rather than by a hand decision each time the body fills. Absent means
  in the body, so forgetting the rule can never empty section 3; only an explicit `inBody: false` retires
  one, and retiring is not withdrawing — the claim and its evidence stay in the record and the appendix.

## A RECORD IS PUBLISHED, so it names hosts and paths rather than quoting them

Everything under `docs/board/reported/` is an input to a **generated document that goes to the board**, and
the repository is public. So a record names a machine by its **inventory name** and a location by its
**declared fact name**; it never carries a raw address, a guest path, or a checkout path. Raw strings, when
somebody genuinely needs them to act, belong in an issue comment.

**Measured 2026-09-09 on #564.** A fleet record written to evidence a real incident carried
a worker's raw LAN address, `C:\Users\witness` three times, and `/root/a11y-witness` — the fleet's own addressing,
on its way into a public repository and a board document. Four guards caught it before it merged:

- *no tracked source file carries a real internal LAN address* (#83's own acceptance pattern)
- *the guest roots' contents are named from a MEASUREMENT, and every site agrees with it*
- *every site naming an SSH key names the fleet key or a DECLARED other one*
- *every site that ENTERS a directory either interpolates the source of truth or is classified*

**None of those guards was written for board records**, which is the point: the record slipped into a
population already fenced for a different reason, and only the fence stopped it. Nothing at the moment of
writing a record says any of this — an author evidencing a fleet outage has no reason to know the rules
exist. That gap is the same shape as a required declaration nothing prompts for (#601).

**`a11y-worker-N answered win_ping` carries the whole evidentiary weight of the same sentence with a raw
address in it, and publishes nothing.** If a figure genuinely needs the address to mean anything, that is worth
knowing on its own, and is an argument for the raw record living somewhere untracked with the document
quoting a summary of it.


**And put the correction in the field that is READ.** A record's fields are not interchangeable: `evidence`
renders into the appendix, so that is where a reader meets it; `affirmed` is consulted only to decide whether
the record has gone stale. A refinement written into `affirmed` is one nobody reads, and a record can be
entirely correct and still say nothing to the board because the sentence went in the wrong field.

## By hand

```bash
pnpm run board:report                          # generate to stdout and read it
pnpm run board:report --post --issue=20     # publish it
gh workflow run board-report.yml              # force one edition now
```

Generating and posting are separate acts on purpose, so a bad report can be seen before it is posted.

**No `--repo` argument, deliberately.** This line carried `--repo a11ign/a11ign`, which the rename
(`e435ac17`) wrote in before the transfer happened — so the documented command names a repository that
does not exist yet and fails for anyone who pastes it. `gh` reads the repository from the checkout you
are standing in, which is right whichever name the remote has on the day. `fetch-board-report.sh` had
already settled the same question for itself — *"THE REPOSITORY IS READ, NOT WRITTEN DOWN"* — and this
page is the copy that did not get the message.

## Is the schedule actually installed, or just claimed? — retired with the launchd path

This section described `npm run jobs:check`, built to ask launchd directly whether a claimed job (a
`.plist` under this directory) was actually installed — because a job that does not exist produces no
output, no log and no alarm, the same silence as a job that ran and found nothing to report. Both plists
went with the launchd retirement above, and the question they existed to answer moved with them:
`board-schedule.test.ts` now asks it of the two GitHub Actions workflows directly (both DST-bracketing
crons present, every working step gated on London's clock) — a stronger answer than `jobs:check` ever
gave, since a workflow file wrong in CI fails the PR that broke it rather than waiting to be asked.

**The machinery is kept, not deleted, in case launchd is ever reintroduced.**
`packages/lab/src/packaging/scheduled-jobs.mjs` and `scripts/check-scheduled-jobs.mjs` still work exactly
as before; `scheduled-jobs.test.ts` now asserts the claimed-job population is EMPTY *by decision* rather
than by discovery failure, and says so by name if a `.plist` reappears here without the floor being
restored deliberately — "the schedule moved" and "the discovery broke" stay different states. Running
`npm run jobs:check` today reports nothing to check, correctly, and is not wired into any gate.

**But that answers PRESENCE, and this section's question is RUNNING.** `board-schedule.test.ts` proves
the workflow FILES are right — both DST-bracketing crons, every working step gated on London's clock — and
a file that is right in CI is not a job that ran. GitHub disables a scheduled workflow after 60 days
without repository activity, silently, and every one of those assertions still passes while nothing has
published for a month. The two are different questions and only one of them had an answer, which is what
the section below is for.

## Is the schedule actually RUNNING, or just present?

**The question survived the move to GitHub Actions; the previous answer did not, and that is the whole of
this section.**

Every refusal in this pipeline is reported BY THE JOB ITSELF — `board-report.mjs` refuses without a
summary and says so, `board-summary-check.mjs` warns eleven hours ahead, both comment on the report issue.
All of it is correct and none of it can fire when the job does not run at all. A job that does not exist
produces no output, no log and no alarm, which is the same silence as a job that ran and found nothing.

Under launchd the risk was an install that never took, or a later `launchctl bootout`. Under GitHub
Actions it is sharper and needs no human error at all: **GitHub disables a scheduled workflow after 60
days without repository activity**, silently, producing no run and no red mark.

```bash
pnpm run board:liveness                        # have the editions stopped arriving?
pnpm run board:liveness --post --issue=20   # and comment once on the report issue if they have
```

It asks about the **edition**, never about the run, and the distinction is not pedantry: both scheduled
workflows carry TWO crons and gate on London's actual hour, so the wrong half of the pair exits
successfully every single day by design. A run-based check reads green while the gate hour matches
neither cron and nothing has been published for a month.

It also refuses to collapse two causes that look identical. No edition with **no summary written** is the
08:00 gate refusing exactly as specified — the pipeline working, and the missing thing is the summary. No
edition with **a summary written** means the gate had no reason to refuse and nothing published anyway;
only that one accuses the schedule. And a GitHub API it cannot reach exits **2**, never 0: whether
editions are arriving is then unknown, and unknown reported as fine is how a check comes to mean nothing.

**It runs on `push`, and that is the design rather than a convenience.** A watchdog that is itself
scheduled has the disease it watches for, because the disable is repository-wide. A push trigger cannot be
disabled by inactivity **because a push IS the activity** — so the one condition that silences the
schedule is the one condition that silences this check, and in that condition a repository nobody has
touched for sixty days having no board edition is not a defect to report.
`board-liveness.test.ts` pins the absence of a `schedule:` key in `trunk.yml`, where the watchdog has
been a step of the `watchdogs` job since #901 (until 2026-09-10 it was a workflow of its own,
`board-liveness.yml`, firing once per push alongside two siblings — 777 runs a day for three scripts that
take seconds). Moving it onto a cron would look like tidying, and would remove the only reason it works.
