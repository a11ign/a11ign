# a11ign — the road to a general release

## North star

Reach the half of accessibility testing that rule scanners structurally cannot: whether what a screen reader
announces, as someone reads and operates a page, adds up to something a person can use.

**In two halves, because they are different jobs.** Where the screen reader's own output settles the
question — a control that announced `collapsed`, was activated, and still announces `collapsed` — the tool
WITNESSES and ASSERTS. Where the question needs a person, it does the TRIAGE rather than the judging: finds
the moment worth looking at, quotes the announcement, and reports `cantTell` rather than guessing.

Recorded here because it was decided on evidence rather than taste, and the evidence is specific. Measured
2026-08-24 on the product path across 18 real pages their publishers declare conformant: **0 criteria
asserted wrongly, 4 referred**. The rule layer is exact on every criterion it owns with 0 false positives
across 1,183 conformant records; the trained scorer never asserts at all, and
[ADR 0021](./docs/adr/0021-the-layer-that-decides-must-be-the-layer-allowed-to-claim.md) records why that is
the right division rather than a shortfall — a subtype whose evidence is decisive belongs with the layer
allowed to state a conclusion from it.

The ambition this replaces — "automate that judgement" — was not wrong to hold, but it is not what the
measurements support, and a north star nobody can verify is a slogan.

## What this file is

**The backlog for one thing: making this generally releasable.** Nothing else belongs here.

It was rewritten on 2026-08-09, when it had reached 1,299 lines of finished work and fixed defects. The
history is in [`docs/history-2026-08.md`](./docs/history-2026-08.md) — read that before re-attempting
anything that looks obviously worth trying, because a lot of it already failed once and the measurements
are recorded.

## Where we actually are

Verified at `39ecc3b` (2026-08-22): 805 tests, lint and typecheck clean, `release:gate` passing end to end
against the recaptured corpus, CI green, `capture:check` passing against a real worker, and the GitHub Action
exercised as a consumer would use it. The infrastructure is in good shape.

The honest shape of the product today:

| | |
|---|---|
| criteria assessed **on a real page** | **10** of WCAG 2.2's 55 A/AA — 1.1.1, 1.3.1, 1.4.2, 2.1.2, 2.4.4 in full; 2.1.1, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3, 4.1.2 **partially**, each with its boundary recorded in `criterion-coverage.ts` |
| criteria the trained scorer covers | 8; at floor **0.70** it scores **20 of 22** calibration pages with **0** false accusations. **Read the positive side as ONE defect, not three** — every form control on all three publisher-declared inaccessible pages is the same unnamed combo box in one template's shared chrome (ADR 0015) |
| false positives on conformant pages | **0**, measured — `release:gate` 2026-08-22: recall 78% over 48 failure-case runs, 0 false positives |
| captures that read the **wrong page** | **0 of 54** on the path that can produce it — ceiling ≈5.6% |
| capture reliability | **0 failures in 2,124 captures** — the full corpus recapture, 4 bare-metal workers, 4 h 34 m, no evictions and no degraded workers retired |
| people other than the author who have run it | **0** |
| free vetoes in the shipped weights | **225** across all 13 heads — a head penalising a feature that is 0 on every one of its training positives, learned at no cost because one page demonstrates one thing. `npm run scorer:shortcuts` (ADR 0015) |
| 4.1.2 on a page that also has a table, or any correctly named control | **not reported** — measured, causal, and being fixed by the corpus rather than the weights |

> **Two of those rows were wrong until 2026-08-21/22, in opposite directions.**
>
> **Capture reliability was pessimistic**: "4 errors in 60 back-to-back captures, clustered at the end
> (speech-channel decay)" described the UTM pool before `ensureSpeechChannel`'s probe and before the fleet
> was bare metal. The current figure is a full corpus run.
>
> **The criteria count was optimistic, and 2.1.2 is why.** It was listed as assessed on a real page while
> `addKeyboardTrap` had never once fired against known evidence: no case targeted 2.1.2, it was absent from
> `rule-ownership.json` so `rules:gate` did not cover it, and it reads `interaction.focusOrder`, which no
> capture carried because `probeFocus` was dropped at the third of three hops that each enumerate case
> fields by hand. The rule shipped, was correct, and was unreachable. It is now validated end to end —
> `2.1.2:focus-trapped 1/1 rules: EXACT` — so the **6** is honest for the first time.
>
> The lesson generalises past this row: **a criterion in a coverage table is a claim, and a claim needs a
> case, a capture, a signal and an owner.** `criteriaAssessableFrom` (`criterion-coverage.ts`) exists to
> make that answerable mechanically rather than by reading four files.
>
> **Four of the nine are PARTIAL, and that is the honest shape rather than a shortfall.** Three of them —
> 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3 — were added on 2026-08-22, and in each case the criterion has several failure modes
> of which a screen reader can prove one. Naming which one, in `criterion-coverage.ts`, is what stops a
> partial claim being read as a whole one.
>
> **All three are failures a static analyser structurally cannot reach**, which is the clearest statement so
> far of what this tool is for:
>
> | | the mode assessed | why markup cannot answer it |
> |---|---|---|
> | 2.4.1 | a skip link that is present and **inert** | a checker sees a link and a plausible href and passes it |
> | 2.4.2 | the route changes and the **title does not** | the markup is valid at every instant; the failure is the transition |
> | 2.4.3 | the tab order **contradicts the reading order** | the DOM has no reading order to contradict until something walks it |
>
> **2.4.2 is recorded as PARTIAL, which is the honest shape.** Page Titled has
> three failure modes and only one is worth a screen reader. A missing title is vanishingly rare — zero
> across 4,895 captures, and absent from the failures covering 96% of WebAIM's million-page survey — and
> whether a title *describes* its topic is judgement, the wall 2.4.6 also stops at. What is now assessed is
> the single-page-app transition: the route moves and the title does not, so the reader still announces the
> page you left. **A static analyser cannot reach that at all** — the markup is valid at every instant, and
> the failure is the transition — which makes it the clearest example so far of a claim this tool can make
> and the rule layer beside it cannot.

That last row is the one that matters most, and no amount of green CI substitutes for it.

### CORRECTION, 2026-08-24: the table above counts criteria that had never run on a real page

The row *"criteria assessed **on a real page** — 10"* was not measured on real pages. It counts criteria
the rules are WRITTEN for. Measured directly, over 3,210 corpus captures and 77 real ones, by running
`ruleFindings` and tallying what came out:

| rule → criterion | fired on corpus | fired on a REAL page |
|---|---|---|
| `addMissingHeadings` → 1.3.1 | **0** | **0** |
| `addAutoplayingAudio` → 1.4.2 | **0** | **0** |
| `addInertSkipLink` → 2.4.1 | 12 | **0** |
| `addStaleRouteTitle` → 2.4.2 | 9 | **0** |
| `addVagueLinks` → 2.4.4 | 62 | **0** |
| 1.1.1 · 2.1.2 · 3.3.2 · 4.1.2 | 350 · 11 · 265 · 425 | 19 · 1 · 6 · 52 |
| 2.1.1 · 2.4.3 | 9 · 13 | 45 · 31 — **first ran 2026-08-24, and both were wrong** |

**Five of eleven rules have never fired on real evidence, and two have never fired at all.** A rule that
has never executed is not a covered criterion; it is an untested assumption with a criterion number.

The two that left that pool did so by accident. `MAX_TAB_STOPS` was 12 while real pages carry a median of
79 focusable elements, so `addKeyboardUnreachableControl` — which refuses to claim anything unless the tab
cycle closes — could never close one, and `addBrokenFocusOrder` found fewer than two shared names and
returned early. Raising the cap ran both for the first time: 2.1.1 reported keyboard-unreachable controls
on **23 of 35 conformant pages**, 2.4.3 on 19. Neither regressed. Both had been wrong all along and silent.

Other rows in that table need the same reading. *"0 false positives on conformant pages"* was measured on
the corpus, where no page has more than 22 focusable elements. *"20 of 22 calibration pages"* is now 38
pages, and the sweep that produced it was passing `truncatedSweeps: []` where the product passes the real
value — 18 referrals measured against 151 reported.

**The generalisation, and it is the reason the section below is sequenced the way it is:** every gate this
project owns runs on a corpus built from the same assumptions as the code it checks, so a shared wrong
assumption is invisible to all of them at once. That is ADR 0019's thesis, and 2026-08-24 found it in a
probe constant, a name normaliser, a calibration sweep, a promotion gate and a test's own fixtures.

## Driving the false-positive rate to zero, 2026-08-25

**FINAL, on the settled 50-page calibration set and 86 conformant real pages in total.**

| | |
|---|---|
| `rules:gate` | **PASS** — 1,183 conformant records, 0 false positives |
| asserted wrongly, product path | **1** of 44 conformant pages scored |
| publisher-declared inaccessible caught | **3 of 3** |
| tool-caused false positives | **0** — all 18 remaining findings checked individually |
| `2.1.1` on conformant pages | 66% → **0%** |
| `2.4.3` | 71% → **6%** |
| `4.1.2` on training pages | 56% → **3%** |
| resolution of the calibration set | 2.6% → **2.0%** |

The one remaining assertion is networkrail's bare `"button"`, traced to markup rather than assumed. The
sweep's own legend governs how to read it: *ASSERTED-WRONGLY counts disagreement with a PUBLISHED CLAIM,
not proven tool error.*



Every finding on a conformant real page was traced to a root cause. **Five were the tool's fault and are
fixed; the rest are correct.** The rates, on conformant calibration pages:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `2.1.1` keyboard unreachable | 66% | **0%** |
| `2.4.3` focus order | 71% | **7%** |
| `2.4.2` stale route title | 3% | **0%** |

**The five defects, each found by reading one page's raw evidence rather than by tuning a threshold:**

1. **Reading order came from a COUNT sweep.** `collectByType` walks backwards from the caret then forwards,
   deduplicating — that is a count of a type and can never be an ordering. On `date-input` the caret landed
   between Month and Year, so the reconstruction placed them seventeen entries apart where the page reads
   them adjacent. The transcript is an arrow read-through and is ordered by construction; 2.4.3 uses it now.
2. **Scope crept while fixing order.** Widening from form fields to every control took 2.4.3 to **74%** —
   cookie banners take focus before skip links that precede them in the DOM, on nearly every real site.
   Two changes in one, and only one of them was wanted.
3. **Composite widgets share one tab stop.** Native radio groups and ARIA's roving-tabindex give a group a
   single Tab stop with arrows moving inside. 2.1.1 reported `Phone`, `Wales`, `Scotland` as unreachable.
   The probe presses only Tab, so a capture cannot tell *reachable by arrows* from *unreachable*.
4. **A capture is not an instant.** `probeDisclosure` activates a control unconditionally, so a toggle's
   name changes under it — `"Expand Quick start"` becomes `"Collapse Quick start"` — and a search panel
   open for the sweep is closed for the focus probe. Both were reported as unreachable controls.
5. **Two characters that are not text.** `clickable` interleaved between containers ended the container
   prefix, making `"form Continue"` a control name; and **U+E604**, an icon-font glyph, sat in one channel's
   name and not the other's, so `"Print this page"` never matched itself. The second is the U+FFFC lesson
   in a different alphabet, and `cleanName` already carried the first one.

**What remains is correct, and that distinction is the point.** Verified individually:

| | |
|---|---|
| `4.1.2` ×2, `1.1.1` ×1, `2.1.2` ×1 | **REAL page failures.** scotcourts' unnamed `<button class="inner mobileMenuButton">`, networkrail's bare `"button"` and its filename-as-alt-text, and one link Tab returns to three times — checked, only one such link exists on that page, so it is not the repeated-phrase ambiguity. |
| `4.1.2` ×4, `3.3.2` ×3 | **Honest `cantTell` on ambiguous evidence.** A combo box announces its VALUE where a name would go, so *unnamed* and *named, value shown* are indistinguishable. Suppressing it was tried and lost three real corpus positives. |
| `2.4.3` ×3 | **Genuine order differences** — a consent control read first and tabbed last. Referred, not asserted. |

**No finding on a conformant page is now the tool's mistake.**

## The goal, and the sequence to reach it

> **PROGRESS, 2026-08-24 evening.** Phases 1-3 worked end to end. Phase 2 and 3 are closed; Phase 1 is
> closed as WORK and its last two validations are waiting on capture time rather than on a decision.
>
> | | |
> |---|---|
> | **1.1** never-fired audit | **DONE** — `npm run rules:coverage`, in `release:gate`, `candidate:gate` and the lab catalogue. Authoritative run named exactly the five predicted. |
> | **1.2** 2.4.3's evidence | **DONE in code** — the sweep records `prevCount`, so document order is recoverable; the rule abstains without it. Validating needs the recapture below. |
> | **1.3** validate or retire the five | **RESOLVED, three different ways.** `1.3.1` and `2.4.4` are scorer-covered, so an unvalidated rule does not leave the criterion uncovered — reported, not blocking. `2.4.1` and `2.4.2` could never fire because `probeNavigation` was never requested for real pages; now on. `1.4.2` reports the true reason at last: its evidence channel is absent from every real capture. |
> | **1.4** re-measure on the product path | **WAITING on the recapture.** |
> | **2.1** the recall-1.000 demand | **DONE** — silent blocks, missing is reported, losing ground is caught on acceptance where two models are comparable. |
> | **2.2** the missing baseline | **DONE** — a schema gap is now a loud NOTE saying every regression check below it is inert, rather than an empty list that reads as "no regressions". |
> | **2.3** free vetoes (B8) | **DONE** — 225 → 67, and 225 → **8** by the measure that matters: 59 sit on rule-decided heads whose model output is suppressed. |
> | **2.4** keep the bound honest | **DONE** — `exact: false` recorded, with what closing it would take. |
> | **3.1** grow the corpus | **DONE** — calibration 38 → **50**, every URL verified 200 first, which caught one 404. Capture queued. |
> | **3.2** what the product promises | **DECIDED** — split by layer. Rules keep "zero" because it is a measurement; the scorer states a bound because its zero was the constraint restated. |
> | **3.3** the threshold cliff | **DONE** — a head at the extreme is named as NO MARGIN, as a note rather than a blocker, because nothing is wrong with it except that it has none. |
>
> **PHASE 1 EXIT MET, 2026-08-24.** Every rule is now either validated on real evidence or reported as
> unvalidated with the correct next step named. `rules:coverage` on the authoritative corpus:

> |---|---|---|
> | rules validated on a real page | 5 of 11 | **9 of 11** |
> | blockers | 5 | **2** |
>
> `2.4.2` and `2.4.3` moved from *never fired on a real page* to validated. The two that remain are
> named precisely rather than lumped together: `1.4.2` has never executed anywhere, and `2.4.1` **ran and
> stayed silent** — its channel exists on every real capture now, so `addInertSkipLink` read them and
> found nothing, which on a conformant page is the right answer. The work there is finding a page with an
> inert skip link, not collecting evidence. Deliberately still a blocker: *a head that has gone silent
> scores perfect precision* is this project's most expensive lesson, and a broken rule is silent on
> conformant pages too.
>
> **PHASE 1.4 — the product path, re-measured on the recaptured set.** At the model's own floor, 36

> The second row is the day's work showing up: 151 was the TRUE figure all along while the sweep reported

> It is recorded rather than silent: those captures carry `{"event":"routeChange","skipped":"deadline"}`,
> so "this page has no navigation" and "we ran out of time to ask" are different evidence — which is the

> evidence OR route evidence, not both, and closing that means a bigger budget rather than a cleverer
> probe.
>
> **What the recapture is for, and why it is the long pole.** Turning on `probeNavigation` and recording
> `prevCount` are both capture changes, so 2.4.1, 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 cannot be validated against evidence
> collected before them. Real-page captures are never cached, so this is unavoidable rather than a cache

>
> **One thing found mid-run that is worth keeping.** The fleet went INCONSISTENT *during* a corpus run:

**The end state:** someone who is not the author installs this, points it at a site they own, and gets
screen-reader-witnessed findings they can act on — each carrying either an assertion the evidence settles
or a referral worth a person's time, with a stated error bound that holds on pages nobody trained on.

Four phases. They are ordered by dependency, not by preference, and each exits on a **measurement** rather
than on work being finished. Every blocker in the list below (B1, B5, B7, B8) is closed (see the
blocker table), so nothing here waits on one.

### Phase 1 — The tool stops making claims it has never tested

*Exit: every rule has either fired on real evidence, or is reported as unvalidated. No rule reports on a
criterion it has never demonstrated.*

The instrument has to be honest about its own coverage before anything else is worth measuring, because
every later number is computed through it.

1. **Ship the never-fired audit as a gate.** It is the general form of today's defect: it would have named
   2.1.1 and 2.4.3 in the morning instead of after they misfired, and it names the next five now.
2. **Fix 2.4.3's evidence.** It compares tab order against `structure.formFields`, which is assembled from
   a sweep walking BACKWARDS and FORWARDS from the caret — on `check-for-flooding` that array is exactly
   reverse document order. The rule's premise is false. The capture already records `prevStopPhrase` /
   `nextStopPhrase` and discards the direction; recording the two walks separately makes document order
   recoverable. **This is a capture change and costs a recapture of the real pages.**
3. **Validate or retire the five.** 1.3.1 and 1.4.2 have never fired anywhere; 2.4.1, 2.4.2 and 2.4.4 have
   never fired on a real page. Each needs either a real page that exercises it or an honest `PARTIAL`
   entry in `criterion-coverage.ts` saying it is unproven.
4. **Re-measure `asserted-wrongly` on the product path** once 1–3 land.

### Phase 2 — A model can actually be promoted

*Exit: a candidate passes `job=promote` on its own merits, and the report states the false-positive bound
it holds rather than a precision that restates its own constraint.*

1. **The promotion gate demands recall 1.000 on every head**, which no learned model can meet. It carries
   the identical flaw `regressions()` already has a scar for — comparing a candidate measured on a harder
   population against an incumbent measured on an easier one — twelve lines away in the same file. **This
   is a decision about what the gate should require, not a bug to quietly fix.**
2. **Establish a baseline.** The shipped model is `screenreader-structured-v7`; the runtime computes `v15`,
   so the shipped weights cannot be scored at all and "is the candidate better?" is currently unanswerable.
   Either promote a v15 as the first-of-schema baseline, or record explicitly that no comparison exists.
3. **B8 — MEASURED DOWN FROM 225 TO 67 on 2026-08-24, and the headline understates it.** Removing
   `vague_link_present` as a model input took 2.4.4 from 27 false positives to **0** with recall rising,
   and cleared 2.4.6 to 1.000/1.000 in the same change. Six heads now carry **zero** free vetoes:
   all three 1.1.1 subtypes, both 1.3.1 subtypes, 2.4.4 and 2.4.6.

   The remaining 67 are not spread evenly, and where they sit changes what they cost:

   | | free vetoes |
   |---|---|
   | in **rule-decided** heads, whose model output `findingsFromScores` suppresses | **59** |
   | in heads that actually decide something in production | **8** (3.3.1 and 4.1.3, four each) |

   So the number that reaches a user went 225 → **8**. The 59 sit on `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.4.1`, `2.4.2`
   and `2.4.3` — every one a head with **3 to 7 positive records**, which is ADR 0015's mechanism stated
   exactly: a head that has never seen a positive carrying a feature can veto it at no cost. The remedy
   is corpus, not weights, and it is Phase 3.1 — these five are the same criteria the rule layer decides,
   so nothing ships on them today either way.
4. **Keep the NP bound honest.** ADR 0022 gives population FP ≤ 0.5% at 95% confidence, recorded as
   `exact: false` because out-of-fold scores come from K fold models where the proposition assumes one.
   Closing that needs negatives held back from training entirely.

### Phase 3 — The claims are defensible on pages nobody trained on

*Exit: an error rate on real pages with enough pages behind it to be meaningful.*

The calibration set is **38 pages, so the finest error rate it can express is ~2.6%** — the sweep says so
itself. A tool that asserts conformance failures needs better resolution than that.

1. **Grow the real-page corpus**, especially conformant pages. The three publisher-declared *inaccessible*
   pages are capped by labelling discipline, not by effort: statements, WCAG-EM reports and GDS monitoring
   all aggregate to the site, and an audit years apart from a capture describes a different page.
2. **DECIDED 2026-08-24 — the promise is split by layer, because the layers differ in kind.** The question
   was whether the tool claims *zero on this corpus* or *a bounded rate with a finite-sample guarantee*.
   Both, and which one depends on who is speaking — ADR 0021's division doing product work:
   - **The rules keep "zero".** They are deterministic, carry no threshold, and nothing was tuned to make
     the number come out. "0 false positives across 1,183 conformant records" is a measurement and stands
     — now paired with `rules:coverage`, because a rule that never fires scores zero too.
   - **The scorer states a BOUND**, not a zero: population false-positive rate ≤ 0.5% at 95% confidence,
     distribution-free (ADR 0022), recorded as approximate. Its old "0 false positives on development"
     was the constraint restated — the threshold was chosen to make it true — and a figure that cannot be
     wrong cannot be informative.

   What this deliberately does NOT do is adopt conformal risk control. It is the more general tool, and the
   generality is not needed: type-I error IS the risk being bounded here, and Neyman-Pearson states it
   directly with a tighter order-statistic result. Revisit if a criterion ever needs a non-binary loss.
3. **Watch the cliff.** Three heads sit at 0.95, the top of the grid. One more negative crossing leaves
   them no valid cut at all.

### Phase 4 — Someone else can use it

*Exit: a stranger installs it, runs it on their own app, and the findings survive contact with them.*

This is B7 → B1 → B5, and it is last for a reason that changed today: **a tool that refers on 7 of 10
conformant pages cannot be handed to anyone.** 2.4.3 currently fires on 71% of conformant real pages and
2.1.1 on 31%. Phase 1 is what makes Phase 4 defensible rather than embarrassing.

1. **B7 — publishing (ours, cheap).** ADR 0007 chose Changesets and independent per-package semver and it
   was never built, so nobody can `npx a11ign`. Half the documented product is unreachable.
   **CLOSED 2026-08-31** — see the blockers section below; kept present-tense here as the record of the
   sequencing decision at the time it was made.
2. **B1 — the first outside user (yours).** Was partly blocked by B7; no longer is.
3. **B5 — the name, and the first publish (yours).** **CLOSED 2026-09-19** — see the blockers section
   below; kept present-tense here as the record of the sequencing decision at the time it was made.

### What this sequence deliberately does not do

- **It does not add criteria.** 11 rules exist and 5 are unproven; a twelfth would be a sixth unproven one.
- **It does not tune weights to make a number look better.** The abstention floor caught a page the tool
  should not have scored, and lowering it would have hidden that.
- **It does not treat the corpus as the gate.** The corpus is a controlled instrument for contrast, and it
  cannot express what real pages do — that is settled, five times over.

## Blockers — a general release should not happen until these are closed

**Status, 2026-08-22.** The line below is kept because it was true when written and is a useful record of
what closing a blocker by measurement looks like. It is no longer the whole list: a re-audit on 2026-08-22
found **two technical blockers nobody had written down**, and one of them means no stranger can install the
CLI at all.

> *2026-08-09: B2, B3 and B4 are closed by measurement. B1 and B5 are yours — neither can be done from
> inside the project. Everything technical that a release was waiting on has a number against it now.*

**UPDATE 2026-09-06: B7 and B8 are closed. This table was written 2026-08-22 and never updated as each
closed — see the dated notes under each heading below for the evidence.** `docs/not-working.md` §8
(closed 2026-08-31) and §2 (closed 2026-09-05, after a same-day reopen and reclose — see its own history)
are the authoritative, current record; this table lagged them by one to two weeks. B1 is no longer
blocked by B7: the CLI can now be installed via the machinery §8 proved out, even though nothing had
been published under a final name yet (B5).

**UPDATE 2026-09-19: B5 is closed. The current list is just B1, yours.** The org transfer to
`a11ign/a11ign` (#63) settled the name; step 12's gate (rehearsal 6, the 13-stage `release:gate`
pinned at the post-transfer head, a dry run, then `ceo`'s dispatch) ran clean end to end and all six
packages published for real — `a11ign@0.1.0` and `@a11ign/{evidence,judge,nvda-worker,scorer,
worker-fleet}@0.1.0`, verified independently against the live registry (`npm view` and a raw `curl`
to `registry.npmjs.org`), all on `latest`, all naming `a11ign/a11ign`. Full record: #63.

**UPDATE 2026-09-25: B1 is closed, by the chairman's ruling, and the list of open blockers is empty.** One person
outside the project had already run the tool for the first time; the chairman relayed their feedback on
2026-09-24 (~08:06Z) and ruled on 2026-09-25 that it is B1's outsider reaction. Their three points, in the
chairman's words: (1) in the YAML, `task: Send an enquiry` "doesn't do anything" as far as the person running the
workflow can see; (2) "most people want more than one page validated on their website", by navigating to where the
user says or from a list of links they supply; (3) "the majority of users who will get loads of value out of this
aren't just marketing sites. It's actually proper SaaS products", and their challenge is that this is "usually
behind auth". **Two things B1's own wording asks for were NOT STATED, and are recorded as not stated rather than
inferred:** a plain statement of whether the output was worth their time, and whether the app was theirs (`ceo`'s
reading of it on 2026-09-24 was a public page). B1 is closed because the chairman owns B1 ("Whose call: Yours"),
not because those two are met, and a later outsider's plain statement, if it comes, is welcome and would be added
here. What the feedback started, each as its own row: `task:` honesty #2268 (closed), a list of URLs #2272
(closed), authenticated capture #2359 (built, closed; ADR 0038). Full record: #2262.

**Recorded 2026-09-25 (#928, D1 and D2): version one DECLARED 2026-09-25 by the chairman,** on the record as it
stands above: the outsider's "worth their time" and whether the app was theirs stay NOT
STATED. The SECOND outsider's run is the first measurement of the next phase, and its "was it worth your time"
verdict is captured in their words. **The next phase's axis is SaaS depth: products behind a login.**
Authenticated capture (#2359) is built; MFA, SSO and CAPTCHA are still out, per `docs/known-gaps.md` §51.

**The phase has a milestone (2026-09-26, `ceo`, on the chairman's ask): `v2 — SaaS depth`.** Its rows are #2557 and
#2561–#2566 and #2568; "Road to version one" is closed, empty. #69 (the split) and #20 (the daily board report) are
not on the SaaS-depth axis and sit in `Out of release`.

| | blocker | whose | state |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B1** | ~~someone outside the project runs it on an app they own~~ | yours | **CLOSED 2026-09-25 by the chairman's ruling** — one outsider's first run, reaction recorded below and in #2262; **worth-their-time NOT STATED** |
| **B5** | ~~the name, and the first publish~~ | yours | **CLOSED 2026-09-19** — see #63, `a11ign@0.1.0` and five `@a11ign/*` packages live on npm |
| **B7** | ~~the release machinery decided in ADR 0007 does not exist~~ | ours | **CLOSED 2026-08-31** — see `not-working.md` §8 |
| **B8** | ~~the scorer's 225 free vetoes~~ | ours | **CLOSED 2026-09-05** — see `not-working.md` §2 |

### B7. ~~Nothing can be installed, and the mechanism to change that was decided and never built~~ — CLOSED 2026-08-31

**Why it blocks.** ADR 0007 chose Changesets, independent per-package semver, and a rule that "a PR that
changes any `packages/*` source **must** include a changeset. CI fails" otherwise. Measured 2026-08-22,
none of it is present:

| | |
|---|---|
| `@changesets/cli` in `package.json` | **absent** |
| `.changeset/` | **does not exist** |
| a CI job that enforces the changeset rule | **none** |
| a publish workflow | **none** |
| git tags / GitHub releases | **zero** |
| `npm view a11ign` | **E404 — nothing is published** |

Two consequences that are already visible in the documentation, and both were found by checking rather
than reported:

- `packages/cli/README.md` opens with `npx a11ign https://example.com` — a command that cannot
  work for anyone, and which is what npm would show as the package's front page.
- The Action was documented as `a11ign/a11ign@v1` in two files: the wrong owner and a tag
  nobody has cut. Fixed 2026-08-22 to `@main`, which resolves but moves under consumers.

**Done looks like.** Changesets installed and wired, a publish workflow, and a first tag — at which point
the Action can be pinned and the CLI can be installed. **It does not require deciding the name (B5):**
the packages can be published under the current name or held until B5 resolves, but the machinery should
exist either way, because building it under time pressure on release day is how a bad version number
becomes permanent.

**Note it is genuinely cheap** — one dependency, one config file, one workflow — which is precisely why it
went unnoticed. Nothing was hard enough to become a visible task.

> **CLOSED 2026-08-31.** `docs/not-working.md` §8: three dry-run attempts against the real workflow, two
> genuine defects found and fixed (`release:gate` cannot run on a bare CI runner — split into
> `release:gate:ci`; `changeset status` was being read after `release:version` had already consumed the

> `confirm` string, `access: restricted`, `action-smoke` for the exact commit). The machinery this row
> said "does not exist" now exists and has been proven to work. **Still not published**, deliberately:
> `access: "restricted"` stays set because B5 (the name) is unresolved and is the user's call — that is a
> B5 gate, not a B7 one, and B7 itself is done.

### B8. ~~The trained scorer penalises features it was never shown, and 225 of them~~ — CLOSED 2026-09-05

**Why it blocks.** Not because the product is wrong today — the layer split contains most of it, and the
deterministic rules are exact where they own a subtype. It blocks because **the defect class is invisible
to every quality gate this project has**, so shipping without closing it means shipping a number nobody
can defend. See [ADR 0015](./docs/adr/0015-one-defect-per-page-taught-the-scorer-to-veto.md).

**Done looks like.** `npm run scorer:shortcuts` materially lower after a retrain on the multi-defect
corpus, **and** held-out acceptance no better than it was. The second half matters more than the first:
the splice probe removed vetoes and cost 3.3.2 eight false positives, and could not distinguish "the veto
was load-bearing" from "spliced input is incoherent". Real pages are the experiment.

**State.** Corpus rebuilt (furniture plus 60 two-defect pages), recapture in flight 2026-08-22. Starved
feature/subtype pairs 263 → 178 by construction, with the rest awaiting the retrain.

> **CLOSED 2026-09-05.** `docs/not-working.md` §2, after its own reopen-and-reclose the same day: the
> retrain (protocol v17) took the count of free vetoes that can reach a report from 225 down to a

> this closure and not required to close B8.

### B1. ~~Someone other than the author runs it on an app they own~~ — CLOSED 2026-09-25 by the chairman's ruling; worth-their-time NOT STATED

**Why it blocks.** Every verification in this repo is one person's, on one Mac, against W3C's own pages.
That is a real gap, and it is the gap most likely to contain a wrong assumption nobody has noticed. A
stranger's first run is also the only way to find out whether six criteria of screen-reader evidence is
worth six minutes of CI to somebody who did not build it.

**Done looks like.** One person outside the project adds the Action to a repo they own, runs it on a page
they care about, and says plainly whether the output was worth it. Their reaction is the deliverable — not
a bug list.

**Whose call.** Yours. This cannot be done from inside.

### B2. ~~The intermittent capture failure is explained or bounded~~ — BOUNDED, 2026-08-09

**Why it blocks.** `capture:check` failed 5 checks, then 1, then passed twice, on unchanged code. A
consumer whose CI goes red for a reason we cannot explain uninstalls the tool — this repo's own note says a
tool that breaks builds the day it is installed gets uninstalled.

It is probably the same fault as the stale virtual buffer (B3): observed once with the correct page title
and the previous page's content. Two guards already catch it — `capture:check`'s identity retry, and the
CLI's `captureMentionsTitle` marking such a capture unverified — but "guarded and unexplained" is not the
same as bounded.

**Done looks like.** Either a diagnosis, or a measured failure rate with a retry that makes it invisible to
a consumer. A number, not a hope.

### B3. ~~The stale virtual buffer, diagnosed~~ — DIAGNOSED AND REMEDIED, 2026-08-09

**Why it blocks.** It can put evidence from the WRONG PAGE into a report. For a tool making accessibility
claims that is the most damaging failure available to it, however rare.

**What is known.** Observed once: correct document title for the page requested, the previous page's
content, one phrase kept over 40 advances, ~2.5 s per step against a normal 0.7 s. NOT reproduced in 25
consecutive page transitions during the real-page corpus capture, with a detector proven to fire on a
constructed fault. `reuseBrowser` is a per-request option now, so browser reuse can be isolated without
editing the guest.

**Watch out.** Two detectors were wrong before one was right — the first measured its own regex, the second
flagged a shared site template as staleness. Prove any new detector fires on a constructed fault before
trusting a negative result.

**Done looks like.** A mechanism, or a bound. The v3 scan in `docs/history-2026-08.md` is the shape to
reuse.

**Progress, 2026-08-09 — a mechanism found and remedied, but not yet a bound.**

NVDA's virtual buffer belongs to the *window*, not to the navigation. Browser reuse re-points an existing
window over the DevTools Protocol, which does **not** rebuild that buffer — so the buffer can still hold the
previous page while `document.title` is already the new one. That is exactly the reported signature: correct
title, previous page's content. `refreshBrowseBuffer` now issues NVDA+F5 (`refreshBrowseDocument`) on the
reuse path only, and absorbs the re-announcement so it cannot be miscounted as read-through movement.

Two things about this are worth more than the fix:

- **The remedy shipped dead the first time.** The guard read a flag that nothing ever set to `true`, so it
  returned early on every capture. Three `capture:check` runs then passed, and it would have been natural to
  credit the fix — while it had never once executed. What found it was asking for the *diagnostic mark*
  rather than the green result. The function now marks `browseBufferFresh` when it skips, so "did not need to
  refresh" and "never ran" can never again be the same silence.
- **One deploy remains unexplained, and is recorded as unexplained.** After a deploy that reported
  `2/2 worker(s)` on the expected hash, neither refresh mark appeared on a reused window — not the success
  and not the failure. The obvious theory, that `/health.code` proves only that the files landed, is
  **wrong**: `CODE_VERSION` is computed once at module load (`server.mjs:172`), so the hash does reflect the
  code the process loaded, and a push without a restart would report stale. No mechanism has been
  established. What is established is the practice that found it — **confirm a capture-path change by its
  diagnostic mark, not by a green result or a matching hash**, because both were present while the remedy
  was inert.

**The number B2 asked for, measured 2026-08-09:** `npm run identity:rate -- --worker=<url> --rounds=20`

| | |
|---|---|
| captures | 60, of which **54 navigated an already-open window** — the only ones that can express the fault |
| buffer refreshed | 54 of 54 |
| **wrong page** | **0** — 95% upper bound about **5.6%** by the rule of three |
| silent / unrecognised | 0 / 0 |
| capture errors | 4 (6.7%), **all four consecutive at the end of the run** |

So: a mechanism, a remedy verified firing by its own mark, and a bound. **B3 is closed** — the mechanism is
known and eliminated rather than detected. **B2 is bounded, not proven absent:** 5.6% is a weak ceiling, and
the honest statement is that the fault has been observed exactly once ever and not once in 54 attempts on the
path that produces it. Raise `--rounds` if a tighter number is wanted; each round is three captures.

Two things the run says that the headline does not:

- **The four errors are the documented speech-channel decay, not this fault.** One hard timeout followed by
  three consecutive `NVDA is running but not speaking`, after 56 unbroken captures — the survival curve in
  `CLAUDE.md`, arriving on schedule. They are reported separately and excluded from the rate, because a
  capture that failed did not read the wrong page; counting them would inflate the fault under test with the
  worker's reliability.
- **The earlier identity failure was this, not staleness.** The single `capture:check` failure this session
  came on a host saturated by a concurrent retrain and was an *empty* read. The harness reported "read the
  wrong content" for both cases, which is why it looked like a stale buffer; it now names which.

### B4. ~~The error rate to defend, decided~~ — ANSWERED 2026-08-09, **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-21**

`node packages/lab/scripts/calibrate-abstention.mjs` sweeps candidate floors over the 7 calibration pages
and reports what each one costs. Measured:

| floor | pages scored | conformant scored | FALSE POSITIVES | inaccessible caught |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0.847 (shipped)** | 0 | 0 | **0** | 0 of 0 |
| 0.75 | 1 | 1 | **1** | 0 of 0 |
| 0.70 | 4 | 4 | **3** | 0 of 0 |
| 0.55 | 7 | 4 | **3** | **0 of 3** |
| 0 (accept everything) | 7 | 4 | **3** | **0 of 3** |

Read the bottom row. Accepting every real page would have the scorer accuse **3 of 4 pages W3C publishes as
conformant** of 4.1.2 failures, while catching **0 of the 3** it publishes as inaccessible. Our own
deterministic rules find nothing on those conformant pages, so "false positive" is the right label.

On real pages this model is not merely uncertain — its output is **anti-correlated with the truth**: findings
where there are none, silence where there are real failures. Abstention is not conservatism here, it is the
only defensible behaviour, and the shipped floor of 0.847 is doing exactly the job it was added for.

**What this changes.** The realism tier stops being desirable polish and becomes the fix for a specific
measured defect. And no error rate needs choosing until a model exists whose accepted predictions are worth
having — asking "what error rate do we accept?" of this one is the wrong question.

**Honest bound on the analysis.** Seven calibration pages support an error-rate granularity of about 1/(n+1)
≈ 12.5% and nothing finer, so this is not a conformal calibration; it is the measurement a conformal
calibration would need. The script says so in its own output.

### B5. ~~The name, and publishing~~ — CLOSED 2026-09-19

**Why it blocked (history, kept).** It was parked deliberately — the packages were unpublished because the name
was undecided. A general release needs a name, a registry presence, and the licence/attribution story checked
once under that name.

**What closed it (2026-09-19).** The org transfer to `a11ign/a11ign` settled the name, and `a11ign@0.1.0` and
five `@a11ign/*` packages are live on npm. Full record: #63.

**Whose call.** Yours.

---

## `evidence:check` said CHANGED after the capture fix — the triage, so nobody redoes it

Exit 1 on 48 sampled pairs: 43 same, 2 drift, 3 changed. **None of the three was caused by the fix.** Two
were the CACHE carrying artefacts already diagnosed and fixed, and one is a screen-reader token this codebase
already treats as unstable.

| changed | cached → fresh | what it was |
|---|---|---|
| `icon-button-unnamed.bad` | `"￼, button"` → `"button"` | **U+FFFC**, Edge autofill |
| `icon-button-unnamed.good` | `"o, button"` → `"open account search, button"` | **focus-mode key echo** |
| `image-missing-alt.bad` | `"graphic"` → `"unlabeled graphic"` | an unstable NVDA token |

**The first two: measured before acting.** A scan of all 2,122 cached captures found 4 with U+FFFC, 1 with a
one-or-two-character control name, and 0 with the doubled quick-nav signature. Five files, so a full
four-hour recapture would have been the wrong response to a 0.2% residue. They were quarantined under
`captures/contaminated-20260809/` and recaptured — 6 captures, 0 failed, each pair from the same worker. The
hand scan is now `verify.corpus.test.ts`, which was verified failing against the corpus that carried them.

Two of the five had the artefact on **one variant only**, which is the shape that matters: an accessible form
focuses the field it rejected, so only the conformant half echoes — the contaminant then correlates with the
property under test and is available to the scorer as a shortcut feature.

**The third needs no action, and the reason is already in the code.** `rules.ts` records that `"unlabeled"` is
the UNSTABLE token — it was missing 1.1.1 on a third of captures of an image with no alt text — so the rule
keys on the STABLE hint (`"To get missing image descriptions, open the context menu."`) which both versions
carry. Worth knowing that the corpus is internally consistent here: 214 of 2,122 graphic-bearing captures use
the bare form and **0** use `"unlabeled graphic"`, because the corpus was captured on a different guest
(`REDACTED-INTERNAL-ADDRESS`) from the one that produced the fresh comparison (`.4`).

**Conclusion: the capture fix is evidence-neutral. No `CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bump, no recapture.** That
is what `evidence:check` exists to establish — the cache key is a proxy, the field-by-field diff is the direct
measurement — and it is also a reminder that a CHANGED verdict is the start of a triage, not a verdict on the
change under test.

**Re-run after the recapture: 48 compared, 46 same, 1 drift, 1 changed** — down from 43/2/3, with the one
remaining change being the unstable `"unlabeled graphic"` token above.

### ~~The one thing this uncovered that is still open: the fleet-consistency guard is inert~~ — CLOSED, 2026-08-22

Two guests appear to announce an unnamed graphic differently — `.6` (which captured the corpus) says
`"graphic"`, `.4` (which produced the fresh comparison) says `"unlabeled graphic"` — and **they share a cache
key**, so nothing prevents their evidence from blending. The key covers NVDA and Edge versions, the Windows
build, the architecture and `provisionRevision`, and the last of those reads **`"unstamped"`** on these
guests, exactly as `CLAUDE.md` warns for guests created before the stamp existed. A guard whose
discriminating field is a constant is not a guard.

> **CLOSED, and by a different route than the one proposed here.** The remedy below — re-provision the pool

It is **not** a live production defect: `rules.ts` already keys 1.1.1 on the stable hint rather than the
`"unlabeled"` token, for this precise reason, and the corpus is internally consistent (214 bare, 0
`"unlabeled"`). But it means the fleet cannot currently prove its guests are interchangeable, and the remedy
is the one already documented — **re-provision the pool together** so both stamp a real revision, rather than
one at a time, which would let two differently prepared guests share an `"unstamped"` key. Not attempted here:
`a11y-worker-3` was in a running-but-not-answering state (a real fault by `worker:ctl`'s own reckoning) and was
stopped, so a two-guest comparison could not be made.

## B6. ~~Captures must survive a heavy real-world page~~ — CLOSED, 2026-08-10

Opened when the first real website this tool was ever pointed at produced a Node stack trace and no report.
Eleven defects, all found by pointing it at that one page, and **not one of them is reachable by the
2,122-capture corpus** — which is the argument for B1 demonstrated rather than asserted.

| what was wrong | how it presented |
|---|---|
| `windowsActivate` unbounded at a second call site | hung 234 s inside a 280 s budget |
| `powershellValue` `execFileSync`, no timeout, in `/health` | `/health` dead for 150 s; "the worker is dead" |
| `findFile` walked the disk on every `/health` | same, from a different syscall |
| `RECOVERABLE` was a regex that could not match `ECONNRESET` | worker EXITED when NVDA's socket closed as instructed |
| boot hygiene ran synchronously inside `listen` | `NOT ready` for 147 s, worse with every capture |
| fallback launcher never passed `--remote-debugging-port` | census impossible, reported as a timeout |
| `MAX_SWEEP_STEPS = 40` — the corpus maximum | page sampled, not validated |
| **one repeated announcement ended a sweep** | **graphics 5 of 66 on a page with duplicate alt text** |
| **one silent step ended a sweep** | **headings 3 of 10, no error anywhere** |
| CLI had no timeout below the worker's own | stack trace instead of the worker's diagnosis |
| `worker:deploy` verified once, immediately | "stale or failed" on guests that had deployed fine |

**Every sweep now ends on `exhausted` — NVDA's own "no next heading" — in both directions**, and the report
states reach as a number: `heading 10/10, landmark 5/4, link 51/58, graphic 59/66`. `evidence:check` reads 46
same, 1 drift, 1 changed, and that one change is the pre-existing cross-guest token difference, so the sweep
work is **evidence-neutral: no protocol bump, no recapture.**

**Two vCPUs was the enabler.** The guests were configured with 2 of the host's 14 cores. Raising them to 6 took
a capture of that page from "abandoned at 280 s" to 2:33, and `example.com` from 90 s to 19 s. Diagnosed by
elimination after a RAM hypothesis was proposed and refuted — memory pressure makes a server slow, and this one
went completely silent while the port stayed open, which is starvation, not swapping.

### The pattern all eleven share, and the rule that falls out

**An ambiguous signal was treated as definitive, and the ambiguity was usually already documented.**
`sweepInDirection`'s own comment said "an unchanged phrase is ambiguous between 'did not move' and 'moved to
something announced the same way'" — and then stopped on the first repeat. `beginsWithRole`'s comment recorded
the landmark-prefix trap twice, and did not strip containers. The remedy was present as prose and absent as
code.

> **When a comment names an ambiguity, the code below it must not resolve that ambiguity by assumption.**

The residual `link 51/58` and `graphic 59/66` are NOT known defects: both sweeps end on NVDA's own signal, so
the gap is between two instruments — the AX tree counts nodes NVDA's quick-navigation does not visit, such as a
graphic inside a link announced as one item. Stated as a number so a reader can judge it.

## Direction, settled by measurement on 2026-08-11

Three candidate directions were tested against evidence rather than argued about. Two are closed.

**A fast announcement ORACLE — closed, because it already exists.** `@guidepup/virtual-screen-reader`
is a shipping screen-reader simulator for unit tests: jsdom, testing-library, jest/vitest matchers,
Storybook. Searching for prior art before building cost an hour and saved the build.

The spike is still worth having, and `packages/nvda-speech` records it: NVDA's composition IS portable —
**6,703 of 6,704 headings reproduced from page source with no screen reader**, and symbol expansion
reproduces `alt="Logo.svg"` → "Logo dot svg" exactly. That is a publishable result and the strongest
evidence-of-contribution this project has produced. It is not a product.

Note what Virtual Screen Reader deliberately is NOT: it targets an idealised spec-compliant AT, validated
against Web Platform Tests, and its heading output is `heading, X, level 1` where NVDA says
`X, heading, level 1`. It answers "what does the spec imply?". It explicitly models no aria-live, no
timing, no interruption, and says "there is no substitute for testing with real screen readers".

**OCCURRENCE — open, unclaimed, and now measured as viable.** Did the page TELL the user what happened?
No existing tool answers it: axe has no AT, Virtual Screen Reader has no live regions or agency, an
LLM-on-DOM sees markup rather than speech, and ARIA-AT tests screen readers against a spec rather than
testing your app through one.

The open risk was reliability, and the argument was that flakiness wrecks ENUMERATION but not VERDICTS.
Measured on the `form-error-silent` pair, three runs each (`npm run verdict:stability`):

| variant | runs | verdict | correct |
|---|---|---|---|
| good — announces its error | 3 | informed, identical announcement each time | yes |
| bad — announces nothing | 3 | not informed, empty each time | yes |

**6 of 6, stable and correct**, on the same infrastructure that produced 3/8/12/13 form fields and
5/59/60 graphics the night before. The reason is structural rather than lucky: a verdict needs one bit,
and an announcement either happened or it did not — variance in HOW MUCH was captured cannot change
WHETHER the error was spoken. Enumeration needs completeness; occurrence needs a witness.

So the reliability problem that dominated 2026-08-09/10 is a problem for the half of the product that is
already commoditised, and much less of one for the half that is not.

**What follows.** Task journeys (ADR 0011) stop being out-of-scope-for-release and become the direction;
breadth of criteria stops being the axis to optimise. The VM fleet stops being an embarrassment and
becomes the reason the unique claim is hard to copy.

## Risks we are choosing to accept, and must therefore state

These are not blockers. They ARE things a reader must be told, and every one is already written into
`RELEASE.md` — this list exists so nobody quietly stops mentioning them.

- **QUALIFIED 2026-08-22 by ADR 0015 — read the entry below with these two corrections.**

  **"2 of 2 inaccessible caught" is ONE defect, observed twice.** Every form control on all three
  publisher-declared inaccessible pages is the same unnamed combo box in the site chrome three pages of one
  W3C template share. The findings are real; they are not three failures, and real-page recall must be
  quoted in distinct defects from now on.

  **And the reason the third is missed is not the abstention floor.** The shipped weights produce NO finding
  on it at any floor. The head penalises `table_present` (-1.26 logits) and `form_field_named` (-4.33) —
  features that are 0 on all 147 of its training positives, so the weights were free — and that page is
  built from 14 layout tables. Ablation on the unedited capture moves it 0.4525 -> 0.9752. Measured across
  all 13 heads: **225 free vetoes** (`npm run scorer:shortcuts`).

  So the numbers below are correct as measurements and describe a narrower competence than they read as.
  The fix is the corpus, not the weights, and it is in flight.

- **RESOLVED 2026-08-21: the realism tier is shipped, and "19 pages is not enough" was right about 19 and
  wrong as a conclusion.** The tier is now **53 pages from 39 publishers** and the scorer scores **20 of 22**
  held-out real pages with **0 false positives**, against 4–6 of 22 before. The superseded measurement is
  kept below because it is why the bigger attempt was made.

  | | previous | shipped now |
  |---|---|---|
  | realism tier | 19 pages, 1 publisher | **53 pages, 39 publishers** |
  | abstention floor | 0.7192 (derived) | **0.70 (chosen on calibration)** |
  | real pages scored, of 22 | 4–6 | **20** |
  | false positives on conformant real pages | 0 | **0** |
  | inaccessible caught (of those in support) | 2 of 2 | **2 of 2** |
  | held-out acceptance | 58 TP / 0 FP / 0 FN | **58 TP / 0 FP / 0 FN** |

  Three things made the difference, and only the first is "more data":

  1. **39 publishers rather than one.** The old tier was all W3C, so it made W3C pages marginally more
     familiar and moved nothing else — which is exactly what "identical cosines, to 4 dp" was reporting.
  2. **The publisher's disclosed exceptions were finally honoured.** The mask had been INERT for its whole
     existence: the join read `claimExcludes` off the captured file, which never wrote that key, so every
     page trained every head as conformant — including criteria the publisher states in writing that it
     fails. 53 of 53 pages now carry an exception.
  3. **The floor is chosen on held-out data instead of derived from the training set's own minimum.** The
     derived value scored one more page but converted an honest abstention into a MISS on W3C's own
     "purchase form, broken" demo.

  What the tier caught that no generated corpus could: `4.1.2:unnamed-control` moved its threshold from
  **0.05 to 0.9**. The trainer picks the lowest threshold reaching zero false positives, so every value
  below 0.9 false-positives on real conformant pages — an 18x error that synthetic data made look safe.

  > **Superseded (kept deliberately).** With a 19-page single-publisher tier: false positives on conformant
  > real pages 3 of 4 → 2 of 4, inaccessible caught 0 of 3 → 0 of 3, nearest-neighbour cosines identical to
  > 4 dp, and 4.1.2 on the generated corpus slightly worse (10 → 11 FP). At the then-shipped floor of 0.847
  > neither model scored any real page, so it would have changed nothing a user sees. The conclusion drawn
  > was that a tier needs materially more than 19 pages before it pays for itself. That was correct, and it
  > is what motivated going to 39 publishers.
- **The gap is unfavourably shaped.** Pages published as inaccessible sit FURTHER from the training
  distribution (~0.59) than conformant ones (~0.73). The scorer is least at home where a finding matters
  most.
- **No expert baseline.** "0 false positives" is measured against our own labelled fixtures and W3C's
  published conformance claims — not against an auditor's opinion of our findings. `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`
  says so; keep it saying so.
- **One screen reader, one browser, one platform.** NVDA in Edge on Windows. Accessibility support is
  demonstrated for that combination and no other, which the report states per run.
- **Page-scoped, not process-scoped.** WCAG claims conformance for complete processes; we examine one URL.
  ADR 0011 records what changing that would take.
- **Windows runner required.** A real adoption constraint, documented rather than solved.

---

## Explicitly out of scope for a general release

Named so they stop being ambient guilt:

- **Task journeys** (ADR 0011) — the next major capability, not a release blocker.
- **2.2.2 and 2.3.1** — the two remaining non-interference criteria. 2.3.1 is visual and belongs to the
  rule layer; 2.2.2 needs DOM animation detection.
- **EARL consumers.** The export exists; nobody consumes it yet, and W3C publishes EARL as non-normative.
- **Multi-worker scaling.** Measured and documented; one worker is sufficient for a release.
- **A second screen reader.** The capture interface is backend-agnostic by design (ADR 0001), and adding
  VoiceOver or Orca is a project of its own.

---
## After the release

The old M0–M4 milestones were removed on 2026-08-09 because they had stopped describing this project. They
listed the `POST /capture` service, the CLI and the GitHub Actions job as outstanding when all three ship;
they cited `src/spike/` paths that no longer exist; and their "100% recall, 0 false positives" figures were
measured against the LLM judge, which contradicts the honest numbers at the top of this file. They are in
[`docs/history-2026-08.md`](./docs/history-2026-08.md) if the reasoning behind an old decision is wanted.

What is actually next, once the blockers above are closed:

1. **A realism tier.** Train on real-page structure so the scorer stops abstaining. The corpus exists
   (ADR 0010); 19 training pages is a start, and widening it means finding more publishers who state their
   own conformance rather than labelling pages ourselves.

   >
   > That fixes Increment 2's specification: **40–60 different publishers, one page each.** Not 40–60 pages.
2. **Task journeys** (ADR 0011). WCAG claims conformance for complete PROCESSES, so a page-at-a-time tool
   structurally cannot assess sign-in or checkout — ours or anyone's. The largest single gap in what this
   category of tool can honestly claim.
3. **The remaining non-interference criteria**, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1, to complete WCAG §5.2.5 coverage.
4. **A second screen reader** behind the existing `CaptureBackend` interface (ADR 0001). VoiceOver is the
   obvious next one and the automation is known-fragile; JAWS is the most representative and the hardest.
5. **An expert-agreement baseline.** The one number that would turn "0 false positives against our own
   labels" into "0 false positives against an auditor".
6. **Assessors as a plug-in point, rather than three hardcoded layers.** There are already three — the
   trained scorer, the deterministic rules, and axe — and only the first two participate in the
   per-criterion picture. axe is bolted on beside them: it gets its own section of the report and
   `criterionOutcomes` still prints `untested` for criteria it assessed seconds earlier in the same run.

   The rule that turns this into an extension point is that **an assessor must declare which criteria it
   COVERS, not just report what it found.** "axe found nothing on contrast" and "axe never looked at
   contrast" are indistinguishable from findings alone, and confusing them is the failure this project is
   organised against. `CRITERION_COVERAGE` is already that shape and is hardcoded to our two layers.

   The payoff is that the visual and DOM criteria become someone else's problem BY DESIGN rather than by
   apology: a contrast checker, a reflow checker or an in-house rule pack each declares its criteria,
   returns criterion-tagged findings, and the coverage picture assembles itself. The claim stops being
   "we check 10 of 55" and becomes "here is the complete picture for this page, from whatever assessors
   were plugged in, and here is exactly what is left for a human".

   Explicitly NOT a reason to reimplement DOM checks here: four of the five DOM-reachable criteria
   (1.3.5, 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 2.5.3) are existing axe rules, and running them through the NVDA fleet would
   spend ~12 s of Windows VM time per page to read an HTML attribute that needs no screen reader at all.

## Known risks

- **JAWS automation difficulty.** Commercial and awkward to drive. Most desktop screen-reader users are on
  Windows (NVDA and JAWS), so leading with NVDA is right, but JAWS is the credibility gap.
- **AGPL on published libraries will deter some adopters**, pulling against the adoption goal. ADR 0006
  resolves it by keeping the engine AGPL and licensing the contracts package Apache-2.0 so third-party
  capture backends are legally writable. That split is effectively irreversible and needs explicit sign-off
  before the first publish — see blocker B5.
- **Packaging can silently change the evidence.** Moving worker files touches `action.yml`'s hardcoded
  server path and the hashed-file list shared by `deploy-worker.mjs` and `check-worker-code.mjs` — the
  mechanism that once had two guests serving stale code for an hour. `evidence:check` reporting SAME is the
  gate; CHANGED costs a full recapture.
- **Capture is OS-bound.** No single portable container runs the whole product; workers live where the
  operating system allows. The portable core hides this from users but shapes the infrastructure (ADR 0001).
- **The scorer may stay abstaining.** The realism tier is the plan, but a frozen-encoder linear head trained
  on generated pages may simply not generalise to real ones. If it does not, the honest product is the
  deterministic rule layer plus real screen-reader evidence — which is still worth shipping, and is what
  ships today.

Two risks were REMOVED as resolved: "trustworthiness of AI judgment — M0 decides it" (M0 is done, and the
answer is the abstention behaviour now documented), and "the default judge backend does not run from a clean
checkout" (verified: `packages/scorer/python/score.py` and the weights are both in `main`).

## Guiding principles

Unchanged, and the reason most of the history file exists:

- **A check must never reject evidence whose absence is the finding.**
- **Unchecked is not clean.** "We could not ask" and "the answer is no" must never be the same output.
- **Automate a check or lose it.** Anything a human has to remember is something that does not happen.
- **Prove a guard fails before trusting it.** A test written against a shape you did not verify is not a
  test.
- **A false positive is an accusation.** For an accessibility tool that is the expensive direction to be
  wrong in, so when the evidence cannot decide, say so.
