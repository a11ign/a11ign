# Agent practices — every session in this repo (chairman's direction, 2026-09-11)

These load with CLAUDE.md in every session. They are habits, not gates; the org clock on #912 reads
whether they are followed.

## Model routing for subagents

- `model="haiku"` for data gathering: file reads, counting, directory walks, grep, API listings.
- `model="sonnet"` for analysis and judgment over gathered material.
- `model="opus"` only for multi-step reasoning that a cheaper tier has measurably got wrong.
- Measured 2026-09-10 over 30 days: Opus carried 66% of billable tokens and Haiku under 1%, with no
  routing rule anywhere. Every subagent call names its model.

## Context

- `/compact` at 50–70% context fill, before auto-compact; quality degrades past 70%.
- `/clear` between unrelated topics; a fresh window beats stale history.
- Batch related requests into one message; every round-trip re-sends the whole config stack.

## Web research

- Measured 2026-09-11 over 30 days: 576 web search and fetch calls put about 2.9 million tokens of page
  content into main-session contexts. Run research in a subagent (`haiku` to gather, `sonnet` to
  digest) so the pages stay in its context and only the digest reaches yours; ask for a digest with
  sources, never a page dump. One fetch that the main session must read itself is the exception, not
  the habit.

## Timers and state

- **No session holds a standing cron. This reverses the rule that stood here until 2026-09-17, and the
  reversal is the point.** Every session used to hold one (engineers every 10 min, the fleet operator
  every 10 min, the product-manager every 30 min), and each firing was a MODEL TURN that woke to ask a
  question a script answers in one API call: about 672 turns a day, most finding nothing. That emptied a
  weekly allowance in three days and put both Codex reviewers on their own quota the same way.
  `CronList` after a restart is no longer the first command; **`CronDelete` on anything you find there
  is.**
- **THE CLOCK WAS NEVER THE DEFECT — a tick that costs no tokens can run all day.** The defect was that
  the tick WAS a model turn. So the tick moved out of the model: `npm run work:tick` runs
  `work-gate.mjs` (two `gh` calls, no model) and hands what it finds to `wake.mjs`, which prompts only a
  session herdr reports as `idle` or `done`, and only once per cause. You are woken WITH the answer
  already in your prompt; you no longer wake to go and look.
- **So: do not create a cron to check for work.** If you think you need one, the gate is missing a
  question rather than you needing a timer — add it to `work-gate.mjs`, where it costs an API call
  instead of a turn, and where the repository can see it. A cron is still right for something that must
  happen at a WALL-CLOCK time regardless of state (a nightly, a board edition); it is never right for
  "has anything changed yet".
- Measured on the agent host 2026-09-17, after the sessions were stopped: no user or root crontab, no
  `at` queue, no systemd timer but `herdr.service`. These were in-session `CronCreate` crons, which is
  why nothing outside the sessions could ever see them — and why this rule, not a host change, is what
  keeps them from coming back.
- The row is the state. Read the row, the PR and the API before acting on any message, including one
  from ceo.
- A product PR opens as a DRAFT and is marked ready only when the reviewer writes "convinced";
  docs-and-tests PRs open ready. Nobody merges by hand.
- **`Acceptance:` and `Closes` are now MERGE-BLOCKING (2026-09-17).** `acceptance` and `ownedPaths` are
  back in `gate`'s `needs`, so a malformed PR body no longer merges red -- it does not merge. Two things
  cost four red runs before this landed, both body defects rather than broken code: a DUPLICATED
  `Acceptance:` section (the checker cannot tell which command to run, so it refuses), and a MISSING
  `Closes` declaration. When a PR finishes no row, the declaration is `Closes: none -- <reason>` with an
  em dash; it is required either way. Editing the body re-runs the check, so a mistake costs a minute.
- **A settled draft with green checks and no verdict is reviewed by the external reviewer (`by reviewer:`);
  an engineer reviews only when ceo names one** — a reviewer stalled past a re-prompt, or a product path
  ceo wants two eyes on. ceo spot-checks the reviewer's first five verdicts and one in five after. The
  chairman's instruction, ruled by ceo on 2026-09-13 (#1394) and effective in ceo's heartbeat v10 (#912,
  comment 5655501080). An engineer with no row in build claims the next Ready row; an open draft is not
  their work unless ceo has named them.
  *A record, not an instruction:* from 2026-09-12 until that ruling, a free engineer reviewed settled
  drafts unasked, because every verdict from 14:02Z that day was engineer-to-engineer and a draft could
  wait thirty minutes between wake-ups for the clock to name someone.

## The API budget — `gh api rate_limit` is a broken gauge (measured 2026-09-22, #1967)

- **Never decide anything from `gh api rate_limit`.** It has been measured reporting a FULL pool during a
  total GraphQL outage of that same token, pointing three quarters of an hour past the real reset. Two
  sessions burned a cycle on it on 2026-09-22: one read the headers and reported the pool exhausted, a peer
  read the endpoint, saw `5000/5000`, and sent a correction stating the finding was backwards and that
  nothing had spent the pool that day. The gauge was wrong, not the finding — and it has now lied twice,
  three weeks apart (#1275, #1967).
- **Read `X-Ratelimit-*` off a real call to the pool you care about** — `gh api graphql -f
  query='{viewer{login}}' -i` for graphql, `gh api <rest-path> -i` for core — and let
  `X-Ratelimit-Resource` confirm which pool answered. **The headers come back on the 403 too**, so an
  exhausted pool is still readable: the call exits non-zero and the response lands on the error's `stdout`
  (`poolFromHeaders`, `queue-table.mjs`). Code already reads them — `rateLimitHeaders`/`logRateLimit` in
  `close-rows-for-merged-pr.mjs`, `apiBudget` in `queue-table.mjs` — so this line is about what you type by
  hand. The harness's own rate-limit advice, to run that endpoint and sleep until the reset it names,
  cannot be corrected from this repo; that is why the correction has to live where every session loads it.
- **Pools are per TOKEN and per RESOURCE, and the endpoint can be right about one while lying about the
  other.** Reproduced 2026-09-22 19:08:44Z, same token, same second: on `core` it read `remaining 4955`
  against the headers' `4954`, same reset — plausible, checkable, true — while on `graphql` it read
  `used 0, remaining 5000, reset 20:08:43Z` against the headers' `used 1360, remaining 3640, reset
  19:19:20Z`. **A sanity check on core is not a sanity check.** `gh pr view`, `gh pr list` and
  `gh issue list` spend GRAPHQL; `gh api` spends CORE; one can be dead while the other is healthy, so read
  the pool you are about to spend rather than the one that answers first. Per TOKEN means every session
  authenticating as the same user shares one counter, and this host has exactly one `gh` identity
  configured (measured the same day) — so there is nothing here to switch to, and the identity class is
  #928's rather than yours.

## `lane:ceo` protects review, not authorship (ceo's ruling, 2026-09-18)

- **A `lane:<owner>` label refuses any OTHER session unconditionally** (`laneReason`,
  `packages/agent-org/src/row-claim/runner-rule.mjs`) — a `Lane-exception:` line in a PR body, or even a
  comment saying "assigned to X", changes nothing at claim time. Only the label does. If the owner is the
  only session that can ever claim the row, the owner's own turn budget is the queue's throughput.
- **Measured 2026-09-18:** 3 engineers idle all morning behind 4 `lane:ceo` rows clearing at ~1/tick,
  because `ceo` was trying to personally author all four and repeatedly lost the claim to B4 file-overlap
  refusals against `ceo`'s own other open `.github/workflows/` PRs — a self-inflicted bottleneck, not a
  property of the rows.
- **The test before leaving a row in a lane other than `any`: does the label protect a DECISION only the
  owner can make (the publish order, a freeze, a ruling — a genuine choice between behaviours), or a PATH
  that needs the owner's REVIEW but not the owner's hands?** `docs/lane-ownership.json`'s own rationale for
  `lane:ceo` is a trunk-health/merge-queue REVIEW concern, and its own `_exception` already contemplates an
  engineer building under a `Lane-exception:` line — the lane was never meant to require `ceo`'s authorship.
  Where it is a path, re-lane to `lane:any` (engineer builds, owner still reviews via the
  `Lane-exception:` line and normal review). Where it is genuinely a decision, it stays, and the wait
  behind it is then a real cost of the decision rather than an accident of the path rule. Full ruling and
  the per-row reasoning: `docs/lane-ownership.json`'s `_claimVsAuthorRuling`, and #1320/#1257/#1397/#1452.

## A reviewer verdict also posts as a GitHub review; requiring one is deferred (ceo's ruling, 2026-09-19)

- **Measured 2026-09-19: 0 of the last 25 merged PRs carried a GitHub review.** Every verdict is prose in
  a PR comment (`**Review of #<n> at \`<head8>\`, by reviewer: convinced.**`), read by `review-verdict.mjs`
  (#1245) and the org's own clocks — but never by GitHub itself. `gh pr view --json reviews` returns `[]`
  on every one of them, so the merge-queue ruleset and branch protection cannot require an approval, and
  no tool outside this repository's code can see whether a PR was reviewed. #1761 is the full measurement.
- **Ruling: verdict-as-review is YES, ruleset-requires-review is NOT YET, and `(provisional)` gets no
  separate GitHub state.**
  1. `packages/agent-org/docs/roles/reviewer.md` now instructs `reviewer`/`reviewer-2` to post
     `gh pr review <n> --approve` (on `convinced`, provisional or not) or `--request-changes` (on
     `not convinced`) alongside the existing comment, body-first-lined with the same verdict. The comment
     is unchanged and stays the evidence (`Acceptance:`, `Mutation:`, findings); the review is the
     GitHub-visible signal, not a replacement.
  2. **The merge-queue ruleset and branch protection require nothing from this review yet.** A bot account
     that also opens PRs (`a11ign-ai-workers` opens every PR here) may find GitHub refuses its own review
     as self-approval — untested, because testing it needs the reviewer's own credentials, which `ceo`
     does not hold. Requiring a review before that is proven would block every merge outright the moment
     it happened to be true. The next real review posted after this rule lands **is** that proof: watch
     `gh pr view --json reviews` on it, and only then open a row to add the requirement.
  3. `(provisional)` stays a word in the comment and the review body. GitHub's approval is binary and this
     repo's own five-in-a-row rule (`reviewer.md`, "Since the line lifted…") already treats a provisional
     `convinced` as the actionable verdict, so there is no second state left for a review object to carry.
- **Why `ceo` ruled rather than referring it:** it changes the merge-queue ruleset's future shape, which is
  `ceo`'s lane per `docs/lane-ownership.json`, and per the 2026-09-18 ruling above (`lane:ceo` protects
  review, not authorship) this is a genuine decision between behaviours (whether GitHub's own machinery
  owns "was this approved") rather than a path needing review only.

## A waiting condition is DATA, not a sentence (chairman's direction, 2026-09-19)

- **If a conclusion changes what should happen next, it goes in a field, not a comment.** The comment
  stays as the reasoning; the field is what moves the org. Every session in this org reads structured
  state and writes prose, and that open loop is the reason the chairman keeps having to intervene:
  **the org can act on what GitHub records, and cannot act on anything it learns.**
- **Measured 2026-09-19: 0 open rows carried a machine-readable blocker; 5 stated one in prose.** Three
  hours of that day, each the same shape — `orchestrator` wrote *"blocked by #1772"* in a comment, #1772
  closed 64 minutes later, and it sat idle with a healthy fleet and five runnable rows; `ceo` wrote
  *"no need to re-check before tomorrow's fire"* on #1234 and was re-woken 2h later for ~18 more
  identical answers; `orchestrator` worked out the control-plane SSH route, wrote it down, and stopped.
- **Waiting on ANOTHER SESSION TO ANSWER → label the row `answer:<session>`.** Measured overnight
  2026-09-20: `orchestrator` needed a ruling from `product-manager`, wrote the question as a comment on
  #914, and **nothing in this org reads comments** — it asked five times over 6.5 hours.
  `product-manager`'s own reply: *"I should have confirmed sooner rather than let five asks go unanswered
  since 01:55Z."* Both behaved correctly; the escalation path simply had no mechanism behind it.
  **Removing the label IS the act of answering**, so there is nothing to remember. A label and not a
  GitHub assignee because only four accounts are assignable here and the eight sessions share them —
  an assignee cannot say WHICH session owes the answer. `answer:<session>` joins `session:*`/`hold:*`:
  one label per session, never one per instance.
- **Waiting on another row → `gh issue edit <n> --add-blocked-by <m>`** (or `--blocked-by` at filing).
  This is **GitHub's own dependency edge**, not a convention this repo invented: the UI renders it and
  `gh issue list --json blockedBy` returns it in the call the gate already makes.
- **Waiting on a date → a `Not-before: YYYY-MM-DD` line in the row body**, because GitHub has no native
  equivalent. A body field and not a label, because a `not-before:<date>` label mints one label per date
  into a vocabulary that already shows that rot (`branch:agent/…`, `worktree:/private/tmp/…`). It follows
  `Acceptance:`/`Closes:` — this repo's own proven pattern of a declared, parsed, tested body field.
- **Both CLEAR THEMSELVES, and that is the whole point.** `blocked` is a claim with **no referent**: it
  says something blocks this row and never says what, so nothing can check it and only a human re-reading
  the row can lift it — which is why 11 rows carried it that day, several waiting on conditions that had
  long since become true. **A waiting condition must name what it waits on, in a form a machine can
  evaluate.** Prefer these two over `blocked`; use `blocked` only for a wait neither can express, and say
  in the same breath what would clear it.
- **No new cause was needed, and that is the evidence the seam is right.** A waiting row leaves its
  owner's population; when the condition clears it re-enters, the owner's count changes, the causeKey
  changes, the wake ledger's dedupe stops matching, and the existing cause fires. A shelved `ready` row
  is reported on the tick log with its reason, never dropped silently.

## Routing — who reads what (chairman's direction, 2026-09-14)

- **`product-manager` is the first reader for rows, the queue and process, and rules on them:** filing and
  amendments, Region and done-when wording, holds, lane labels, promotions, claim reports, merge close-outs,
  host-run announcements. An engineer's completion or claim report goes to `product-manager`, never to
  `ceo`. Three things come up from `product-manager` to `ceo`: a ruling they cannot make (a rule or ADR
  conflict, a crossing into a `ceo` lane, the publish path); ONE state reading per `ceo` tick — utilisation,
  queue, drafts awaiting a verdict, anything red — posted on #928 at :05/:25/:45 so the tick at :09/:29/:49
  reads it; and anything for the chairman.
- **`orchestrator` is the first reader for fleet and lab questions** — a capture's history, a worker fact,
  a lab reading. Engineers ask directly; the answer is posted on the row.
- **The author of a draft prompts its parity reviewer** the moment the PR opens and again after every push
  that changes the head: `npm run prompt:session -- reviewer "Draft #<n> (odd) …"` for odd numbers,
  `reviewer-2` for even. **`prompt:session` CLEARS THE SESSION FIRST, and the raw
  `herdr ... agent prompt` this line used to name does not** — that is the whole reason it exists.
  `wake.mjs` has cleared before every order it delivers since #912 (690k → 37k input tokens on a real
  session, an 18× cut), but an author calling `herdr` directly bypassed it. Measured 2026-09-19 on a real
  `reviewer` transcript: six reviews in one unbroken session — #1765, #1767, #1769, #1771, #1775, #1777 —
  only #1765 delivered by the gate, 2.29M cached input tokens carried, and at least one auto-compact. Use
  the raw call only for a RE-prompt about the same draft, where the reviewer's existing context is the
  point. `ceo`'s tick no longer does it; a draft with no verdict 30 minutes after the
  author's prompt is reported to `product-manager`, who re-prompts once and then tells `ceo`.
- **ONE CALL IS ENOUGH, AND RETRYING IS NOW THE WRONG THING (#1966, 2026-09-22).** `prompt:session` used
  to print `NOT PROMPTED: "reviewer" is working` and exit, and **that was the end of the order** — nothing
  re-offered it, and nothing outside the author's own terminal knew one had existed. Measured while filing
  draft #1963: three refusals in 4m37s, delivery only on the fourth, and only because the author held a
  retry loop open inside its own turn. It now **queues** the order (exit `2` is `QUEUED`, not a failure)
  and the next `npm run work:tick` delivers it, cleared, once the gate judges that session between tasks.
  **Do not retry, and do not poll:** this command clears its target first, so a retry that lands the
  instant a busy session goes idle wipes the review it interrupted — `reviewer` was mid-review of #1963
  during that exact window. A refusal naming a session the org does not know is the one that is still
  yours: that is a typo, it is NOT queued, and it says so.
- **`ceo` keeps:** the publish order and every freeze decision, reviewer spot-checks, the board edition read,
  rulings that reach it through `product-manager`, and the chairman.
- **Why (measured 2026-09-14, ceo's own inbound):** about half of one night's messages to `ceo` were
  read-backs and reports that needed a nod, not a decision; each cost a Fable turn and a tick's latency, and
  reviewer nudges waited up to twenty minutes for a heartbeat that an author could have replaced with one
  command. The rule that stays: the row is the state — a report to `product-manager` changes nothing until
  the row, the PR and the API say so.

## Assertions

- **An emptiness assertion names where its positive control lives.** `assert.deepEqual(offenders, [])`
  passes when the population is empty, so somewhere there must be an assertion that it is not — and the
  writer has to be able to point at it. A control you believe in is not one you can point at.
- **Where the population comes from decides whether a machine can help you.** Measured over 236 such
  assertions, 2026-09-12: 64 derive from a local collection (`const xs = ys.filter(…)`), and
  `local/uncontrolled-emptiness` refuses those unpinned — **64 derive from a CALL** (`f().filter(…)`),
  where no rule can trace the source without guessing at what `f()` returns, so those have **only this
  line**. 73 are accumulators and 17 unclassified, both with their own rows.
- **This is a habit and this repository loses habits**; the reason it stays one is that the alternative
  is a rule that infers intent, which is the defect this family is about one level up. A habit that
  decays beats a guard that guesses, and #1157 records the trade rather than pretending it is not one.
