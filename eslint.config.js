// CLAUDE.md, because no linter can decide it.
//
// Errors block CI. Warnings are surfaced but non-blocking, reserved for rules

/**
 * #1144: A READ OF `statusCheckRollup` MUST NARROW IT TO THE NEWEST RUN PER NAME.
 *
 * The rollup UNIONS superseded runs, so a raw filter answers about every attempt ever made -- a
 * superseded FAILED run survives on the head for ever and reports a green PR as failing, which is what
 * `merge-queue.mjs` did until #634.
 *
 * THIS IS AN AST RULE BECAUSE THE GUARD IT REPLACES WAS A LINE REGEX, AND THAT IS THE POINT RATHER THAN
 * A PORTING DETAIL. `bounded-window-reads.test.ts` asked whether the LINE mentioned a window-naming
 * predicate, so a raw read passed whenever its line mentioned a wrapper for any reason -- an unrelated
 * call, an import. That is the guard's own recorded defect one granularity down: its header says the
 * first version asked whether the FILE mentioned one and `npm run mutate` reported THE GUARD DID NOT
 * BITE, *"a check observing something ADJACENT to the property, where the adjacency holds while the
 * property fails."* Per-line fixed the file case and kept the shape.
 *
 * This asks whether THIS read is wrapped, which is the property itself. It also sees a read split across
 * lines, which a line regex cannot. Both holes were latent rather than live -- all 21 rollup reads in the
 * tree passed the old predicate correctly -- and that is stated on #1144 rather than claimed otherwise.
 *
 * EXEMPT BY OPTION, not by a table in a test: `wideWindowIsHarmless` is the rule's own fixture per #908
 * clause 3. It is EMPTY today, and THE MEASUREMENT IS THE LINT RUN ITSELF -- an unwrapped read anywhere in
 * the tree is an error, so "the option is empty and lint is green" is a continuously re-proved statement
 * rather than a count that goes stale. (It said "all four readers narrow" until #1152; the number was
 * ambiguous between the wrappers and the call sites, and it was already wrong for one of the two readings.)
 * The option exists so a reader that genuinely does not need the newest answer is CLASSIFIED rather than
 * made to adopt a predicate it has no use for. "Nothing needs this" and "somebody forgot" must not be the
 * same state.
 *
 * A NAME ON THIS LIST IS A CLAIM ABOUT BEHAVIOUR, so each one is proved where it can be. `newestPerName`
 * and `newestConclusionOf` are driven in `bounded-window-reads.test.ts`; `newestRun` and
 * `newestRunCompletedAt` (#1152) in `update-branch-decision.test.ts`, which is where they can be driven
 * at all -- importing `update-branch-sweep.mjs` into the guard file would give it a `token` requirement
 * through its closure (`deriveClosureRequirements` -> token via update-branch-sweep.mjs -> gh) and
 * disqualify it from the job that runs acceptance commands. Without a proof SOMEWHERE, extending this list
 * is how a reader that does NOT narrow gets admitted by being called the right thing.
