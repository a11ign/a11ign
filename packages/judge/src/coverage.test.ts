/**
 * The coverage list is a CLAIM, so it is pinned to the things it claims about.
 *
 * "We assessed N of 55 criteria" is printed on every report and is the whole basis of the Conformance
 * Requirement 1 statement. A hand-maintained list behind that number goes stale the first time somebody
 * retrains with a new head — and it goes stale silently, because nothing else in the pipeline reads it.
 *
 * These tests make that impossible: the list must equal the shipped model's own criteria, and the rules
 * must not be able to emit anything outside it.
 *
 * A bare `deepEqual` between the two (this test's own shape until #84) cannot tell a REMOVAL from an
 * ADDITION, and they are not the same event. A criterion arriving is ordinary: something was built. A
 * criterion disappearing means a capability the last release had is gone — and the failure's own obvious
 * remedy, editing `SCORED_CRITERIA` until it matches, closes the test, ships the removal, and records
 * NOTHING, identically whether the removal was correct or an accident. `3.3.2:unnamed-form-field` almost
 * shipped exactly that way: a legitimate retirement, fully reasoned in `case-matrix.mjs`, that still cost
 * an evening because nothing connected a head vanishing from a training report to the comment explaining
 * why. See `check-retired-heads.mjs`'s own header for the full incident.
 *
 * So growth and shrink now ask different questions, reusing that file's `headSet`/`retiredHeadsVerdict`
 * rather than a third copy of the comparison: a criterion the report gained still requires updating
 * `SCORED_CRITERIA` (accuracy — the printed count must not read LOW), but a criterion the report LOST is a
 * REFUSAL unless `retired-heads.json` names it, when, why, and where the reasoning lives (safety — a
 * shrink recreates the evening if it is only a diff).
