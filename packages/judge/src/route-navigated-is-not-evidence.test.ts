/**
 * `routeChange.navigated` WAS `true` on every successful activation `probeRouteChange` recorded,
 * regardless of whether the view actually moved -- a tautology, fixed #1850, which now derives it from
 * NVDA's own document-change announcement. This guard forbids reading it in files that have not been
 * measured against the new signal: the real evidence for these findings is, and stays,
 * `titleBefore`/`titleAfter`/`headingBefore`/`headingAfter`; `route.control === null` is the correct
 * applicability gate ("was anything probed at all"). `addInertSkipLink` in `rules.ts` and
 * `routeTitleIsStale`/`skipLinkIsInert` in `signal-predicates.mjs` still use it as their whole premise --
 * TWO independent implementations of the same two rules, discovered a second time by a peer session after
 * this guard first shipped covering only `rules.ts`. That is exactly the shape this scan exists to stop
 * recurring: a hand-maintained file list is the thing that goes stale, not the pattern.
 *
 * **`packages/judge/src/rules.ts` and `packages/lab/src/training/signal-predicates.mjs` are now the
 * documented exceptions (#1867).** `addStaleRouteTitle`'s own heading-equality guard read a held-steady
 * SITE-CHROME heading as "nothing navigated" even when the title differed and NVDA's own document-change
 * confirmation said otherwise -- the guard needed *some* signal a navigation happened before comparing
 * titles, and `navigated` is that signal for this one rule now that it has been measured against it
 * (`rules.test.ts`'s `#1867` cases). This is precisely what this guard's own design anticipated: *"A future
 * row that wants `navigated` as evidence removes this guard's coverage for the one file it changes,
 * deliberately, rather than this scan quietly losing its teeth everywhere at once."* `signal-predicates.mjs`
 * was not part of #1867's ORIGINAL Region -- product-manager widened it (PR #1871 review) once the reviewer
 * found `routeTitleIsStale` there is the same guard's premise on the same shape, still trusting the heading
 * proxy alone; it now carries the mirrored fix and the same documented exception.
 *
 * This scans SOURCE TEXT rather than asserting behaviour, because the hazard is a FUTURE line, not a
 * present one -- the same shape `structure-declarations.test.ts` uses for exactly the same reason: `tsc`
 * cannot see "a new call site read a field it should not", and a behavioural test can only fail once
 * something has already gone looking for the tautology and found it. Comments are stripped first so the
 * doc comments explaining this by name do not trip their own guard.
 *
 * DISCOVERED, not hand-listed, for the TS/JS side: any non-test source file under `packages/` that
 * mentions `routeChange` at all is a candidate consumer and is scanned. `navigatedOnSubmit.navigated`
 * (verify.ts, local-judge.ts) is a different field on a different object and is correctly untouched --
 * confirmed those files never mention `routeChange`, so the discovery naturally excludes them without
 * needing to name them. The Python featurizer is the one EXPLICIT, sentinel-checked exception: it does
 * not read `routeChange` at all today (nothing to discover), but the issue's own region names it as
 * in-scope for when it does.
