/**
 * `@huggingface/transformers` IS OPTIONAL, AND ITS ABSENCE MUST NOT BE A BARE MODULE-NOT-FOUND.
 *
 * `ENABLED` is read once at module load from `JUDGE_GATE`/`GATE_MODEL_PATH`, so the enabled path can only
 * be exercised in a fresh process -- these tests spawn one against the BUILT `dist/internal.mjs` (a plain
 * subprocess needs no `tsx`, and this package's own `prepack`/`prepare` already keep `dist` current).
 *
 * Reproduced from a real tarball install (architecture-audit.md §4.5, §3.5): `@huggingface/transformers`
 * was declared in no manifest, so a consumer who followed the header comment's own instruction --
 * `JUDGE_GATE=on GATE_MODEL_PATH=... npm run eval` -- without also running `npm install
 * @huggingface/transformers` got `Cannot find package '@huggingface/transformers'` out of `judge.ts:642`,
 * which has no catch around `applyGate`, so the WHOLE `judge()` call died rather than just the gate.
