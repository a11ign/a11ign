/**
 * The judge with no rented expert: our own trained scorer, plus a deterministic evidence guard.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `judge.ts` is GENERATIVE — an LLM reads the transcript and both finds and describes problems. That
 * needs an account and a network, so the GitHub Action was built around a hosted key. But
 * `docs/local-model.md` describes an LLM-free path: the scorer answers "does this evidence support
 * criterion X?", and "a report explanation can then be rendered from the captured evidence and a fixed
 * WCAG template."
 *
 * The scorer takes a WHOLE capture and returns one score per criterion — it does not need candidate
 * findings generated for it, which is what `score_records` does today and what
 * `score-screenreader-model.py --stdin` already accepts. 87 MB encoder, 27 KB of heads, milliseconds.
 *
 * ## The guard is defence in depth, and the first diagnosis of WHY was wrong
 *
 * On a real capture of a page whose only fault was an unnamed icon button, the model predicted three
 * criteria — 4.1.2 at 0.993 (correct), 3.3.2 at 0.495 and 2.4.4 at 0.190 on a page containing NO LINKS.
 * I read that as threshold drift: calibration tuned for a paired dataset rather than for reporting on one
 * page, and wrote this guard to remove it.
 *
 * That was the wrong cause. The capture was being fed to the model with `structure` and `interaction`
 * MISSING, because the CLI's `--json` output dropped them — so 29 of the model's structured features read
 * zero and its scores went noisy. The same page, captured completely:
 *
 *     with structure omitted:   2.4.4 0.190   3.3.2 0.495   4.1.2 0.993
 *     with structure present:   2.4.4 0.000   3.3.2 0.114   4.1.2 0.998
 *
 * The model was starved, not miscalibrated. Fixed at source, and this is why it is worth chasing a cause
 * rather than filtering a symptom: the guard would have shipped, looked like it worked, and left the
 * model running on a third of its inputs.
 *
 * The guard stays, because it is independently right — a finding about link purpose on a page with no
 * links is indefensible at any score, and the same rule holds everywhere in this project: never claim
 * what the evidence cannot support. It is now a second line rather than the fix.
 *
 * On CONFORMANT pages the model is silent regardless: 0 findings across 150 conformant records.
