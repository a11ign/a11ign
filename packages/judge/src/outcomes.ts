/**
 * Per-criterion outcomes in the vocabulary of the W3C's ACT Rules Format.
 *
 * ACT defines FIVE outcomes — `inapplicable`, `passed`, `failed`, `cantTell`, `untested` — and this tool
 * emitted only findings, which is `failed` and nothing else. So "0 findings" silently meant any of four
 * different things:
 *
 *   passed        we checked and the page is fine
 *   inapplicable  there is nothing of that kind on the page to be right or wrong about
 *   cantTell      we could not determine it — the scorer abstained, or a sweep stopped early
 *   untested      no assessor of ours covers that criterion at all
 *
 * Collapsing those into one number is the exact defect this project fights everywhere else. `local-judge`
 * already says "unchecked, not clean" in prose and axe's absence is already distinguished from a clean
 * scan; ACT supplies the standard vocabulary to say it per criterion, machine-readably, so a CI consumer
 * can act on it.
 *
 * **Applicability is NOT redefined here.** `hasEvidenceFor` already answers "is there anything of the right
 * kind here to be right or wrong about?" for every criterion we cover, and its table carries rationale measured
 * the hard way — Wikipedia navigating on submit, apache.org's search toggle that submitted nothing. A
 * second applicability table would drift from that one, and the drift would be silent.
 *
 * Specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/
