/**
 * ONE RESOLUTION OF "WHICH BACKEND IS ACTIVE" — it was written out in four places and they had drifted.
 *
 * `judge.ts` carried the reason, having been bitten by it: "`||`, not `??`: an env var set to the EMPTY
 * string is how CI passes 'unset', and `??` only defaults on nullish — so an empty JUDGE_BACKEND selected
 * no backend at all here rather than the intended default."
 *
 * The remedy reached one of the four. `lab/eval/run.ts` still had `??`, and it uses the value for
 * `c.notApplicableTo?.includes(BACKEND)` — so with `JUDGE_BACKEND=""` no case ever matched and cases the
 * local scorer CANNOT assess were scored rather than excluded, against a comment three lines away saying
 * an exclusion "can never be mistaken for a pass".
