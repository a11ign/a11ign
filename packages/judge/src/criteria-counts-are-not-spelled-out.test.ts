/**
 * A NUMBER IN PROSE IS A NUMBER THAT STOPS BEING TRUE.
 *
 * `local-judge.ts` states the rule, having been bitten by it: `layerSummary` hardcoded "eight" and went
 * stale "the day 1.4.2 and 2.1.2 arrived", so it now COUNTS instead. The lesson did not reach the
 * comments, and by 2026-08-29 eight of them were wrong at once — including `coverage.ts`'s own header,
 * the file whose entire job is to stop coverage claims drifting, which said "We assess eight of
 * fifty-five" while `assessedCriteria()` returned FOURTEEN.
 *
 * The numbers were: 55 total, 14 assessed, 41 untested. The prose said eight assessed and 45 or 47
 * untested, in different files, none agreeing with another.
 *
 * None of it had a runtime effect — `conformanceScope` computes from the list it is handed, and its test
 * uses an 8-criterion FIXTURE, which is why "Assessed 8 of 55" is correct there and stale everywhere else.
 * A reader has no way to tell those apart, which is the harm.
