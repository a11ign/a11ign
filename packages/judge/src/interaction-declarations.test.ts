/**
 * ONE DECLARATION OF WHAT A CAPTURE'S STATE AND FORM CHANGES ARE -- known-gaps §15's defect, one field over (#1603).
 *
 * §15 fixed `structure` being declared seven times; `structure-declarations.test.ts` guards it. The same defect stood
 * on `interaction`: eleven declarations outside the wire type spelled `stateChanges` or `formChanges` inline, and four
 * of them declared `formChanges[].kind` while `CaptureInteraction` did not -- the understating direction §15 names,
 * where object spread hides the gap at runtime for as long as it exists.
 *
 * Each declaration now derives from `CaptureInteraction`: the list itself, `Pick`, or indexed access to its element,
 * loosened where a consumer genuinely accepts more (every field optional, `after` admitting `null`) and saying why.
 * `tsc` enforces the derivation (a key the wire does not carry does not compile). What it cannot see is somebody
 * writing a fresh inline shape, which is how the eleven arose -- so this test reads for that.
