/**
 * THE MAPPING IS DECLARED IN `act-rules.ts` AND EMITTED IN `rules.ts`, AND NOTHING COMPARED THEM.
 *
 * On 2026-09-04 three criteria were downgraded from asserting a conformance failure to reporting
 * `cantTell`: 3.3.3, 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. The ACT declarations were edited, the audit was written, the backlog
 * was marked DONE — and the three `add(..., "conformance")` literals in `rules.ts` were never touched. The
 * shipped judge went on asserting for a day, so a login page correctly saying "Incorrect password" (which
 * 3.3.3's security exception REQUIRES) was reported as a hard conformance failure.
 *
 * THREE TESTS ALREADY BELIEVED THEY COVERED THIS AND ALL THREE WERE GREEN.
 *   - `act-rules.test.ts`'s "only the announcement-reading rules claim conformance" reads the static
 *     ACT_RULES array. That array was correct. It never invokes `ruleFindings`.
 *   - `rules.test.ts`'s parallel check DOES invoke `ruleFindings`, but its fixture is a bare graphic and a
 *     combo box, which reaches neither `addErrorWithoutRemedy` nor `addContextChanges`.
 *   - `criterion-coverage.test.ts` asserts against prose that also described them as non-asserting.
 *
 * Each was testing a real thing. None could reach the two functions that regressed, and a fixture-driven
 * test only ever covers the paths its fixture happens to walk — which is why this one is derived from the
 * SOURCE rather than from a fixture. It cannot miss a call site by failing to construct the input for it.
 *
 * Source text, with the anti-vacuity guards that requires.
