/**
 * Our deterministic rules, described in the form the W3C's ACT Rules Format requires.
 *
 * ACT specifies what a rule must state before anyone can judge whether its output means anything:
 * applicability, expectation, assumptions, accessibility-support limitations, and examples of each
 * outcome. We had all of that as prose comments beside the code — which is where it belongs for a reader
 * of the code, and nowhere at all for a reader of a report.
 *
 * The two fields that earn this file are `assumptions` and `accessibilitySupport`. Every wrong finding
 * this project has shipped traces to an assumption nobody had written down: that Chromium marks decorative
 * images as ignored (it does, but it also exposes CSS bullets as images), that a submit always stays on the
 * page (Wikipedia navigates), that a leading role token means an unnamed control (true only in the sweep,
 * not in a wrapped read-through). Writing them down is how the next one gets caught in review.
 *
 * These are OUR rules, not a claim to implement the ACT rules published by the community — those have
 * their own identifiers and test cases, and adopting them is a separate piece of work.
