// THE CRITERIA LIST IS WRITTEN IN FIVE PLACES, THREE OF THEM READ BY STRANGERS.
//
// `RULE_CRITERIA` is the truth. `README.md`, `RELEASE.md` and `action.yml` each restate it in prose, and on
// 2026-08-22 all three said SIX while the tool assessed ten — the count had moved four times that day and
// nothing compared them. Worse, README told a reader "the local scorer is not integrated yet" and "a
// frontier model calling an API is the current engine", while `judge.ts` reads
// `(process.env.JUDGE_BACKEND || "local")`.
//
// That matters more than an ordinary stale comment. PLAN.md names B1 — someone outside the project running
// this on an app they own — as THE release blocker, and these three files are their entire first contact.
// This project has already shipped a RELEASE.md claiming "0 false positives" and that `eval:gate`
// "reproduces these exact figures", neither of which was true.
//
// So: drift becomes a test failure rather than a thing someone notices later. Today's own lesson, applied
// to documentation — when a fact must live in several places, pin the copies equal.
