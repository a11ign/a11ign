/**
 * Deterministic absence-criteria rules.
 *
 * Some WCAG failures are not judgment calls — they are the literal ABSENCE of an
 * accessible name. A screen reader announces these as a role with no name (the
 * U+FFFC object-replacement char, "￼"), e.g. "edit, ￼" or "graphic, ￼". An LLM
 * or NLI verifier cannot reliably infer a violation from "nothing was
 * announced", but a rule can: if the name is empty, it is unlabelled, full stop.
 *
 * These rules run alongside the model-based verifier (which keeps the SEMANTIC
 * criteria: vague links, non-descriptive headings, etc.). They are exact: they
 * only inspect image announcements and role-only controls, never links or
 * headings, so they cannot produce the over-flagging the generative judge did.
 *
 * A note on announcement strings (verified against the real NVDA captures in
 * packages/lab/src/eval/fixtures/nvda/nvda-w3c-*.json, 2026-06-29): published guides document an
 * unlabelled control as "edit, blank" and unnamed image-in-link as a filename or
 * spelled-out URL. Those are JAWS/VoiceOver/version-specific — they do NOT match
 * what our NVDA pipeline emits. Our NVDA announces an empty name as the U+FFFC
 * marker (below) or the literal word "Unlabelled". In our captures the bare word
 * "blank" is empty-LINE/spacing noise on its own line, never role-adjacent, so it
 * is NOT an empty-name signal here and must not be keyed on (it would false-fire
 * on spacing). Validate any new announcement-string rule against our own captures,
 * not against a book's strings.

/**
 * NO state-change rule here — but NOT for the reason this comment gave until 2026-08-21, which was wrong
 * and expensive.
 *
 * A disclosure that opens without announcing `expanded` is a real 4.1.2 failure, and it is trivially
 * detectable: the corpus gives `"Travel advice, button, collapsed"` -> `"..., focused, collapsed"` for the
 * failing variant and `..., focused, expanded` for the conformant one. A rule on that reached 69/69 EXACT
 * with no false positives across 1001 conformant corpus records.
 *
 * ## The retracted claim: "the evidence does not contain the fact the rule needs"
 *
 * This comment used to argue that the capture could not distinguish a control that was ACTIVATED from one
 * merely FOCUSED, because the announcement says `focused` either way — and concluded the rule was unsound
 * until the probe recorded post-activation state.
 *
 * **That is not what the probe does, and never was.** `probeDisclosure` calls `nvda.act()` — Enter on the
 * control — and only THEN calls `reportFocusedControlWithRetry`. So `after` is already the post-activation
 * state. The word `focused` appears because `reportCurrentFocus` reports the focused control; it is not
 * evidence that focus was all that happened. The state token sits beside it.
 *
 * Proved by capture, not by reading: when `menus-good.html` was given a working toggle, the recapture
 * recorded `"Support, button, focused, expanded"`. If the probe only focused, `aria-expanded` would still
 * be false and it would have said `collapsed`.
 *
 * The real cause of that "conformant page reported as failing" was the FIXTURE. It carried
 * `aria-expanded="false"` with no script and a submenu that was never hidden, so `collapsed` was a false
 * statement and activation genuinely changed nothing. The page was mis-authored and the finding was correct.
 *
 * This mattered beyond tidiness: a stale comment describing a capture gap that did not exist talked a
 * later reader into planning a `CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bump and a full 2,122-capture recapture to fix it.
 * When a comment names a limitation, check the code still has it.
 *
 * ## Why there is still no rule here
 *
 * The reason is now ownership, not evidence. `4.1.2:state-change-silent` is model-owned
 * (`rule-ownership.json`) and scores **59 true positives, 0 false positives, 0 false negatives** on
 * development. A deterministic rule would duplicate a decision that already holds, and this repo's whole
 * ownership declaration exists so exactly one layer decides each subtype.
 *
 * The one argument that survives is narrow and worth testing before acting on: rules still run when the
 * scorer ABSTAINS, and it abstains on 5 of 16 eval failure cases. A rule would reach those pages. Note the
 * "50.7% to 74.5%" figure this comment used to quote predates the current model and must not be reused as
 * the expected gain — measure it against today's scorer or not at all.
 *
 * ## What IS still true: the ambiguity, in the other direction
 *
 * A control that legitimately does not change state when activated — a menu that opens on hover, a disabled
 * toggle, a panel already open — produces evidence indistinguishable from a failure, and the model will
 * call it one. That is a real limit on both layers. It is not a capture gap: the capture records exactly
 * what happened. It is that "nothing changed" has two causes and the page cannot tell you which.

/**
 * A control that announces an expandable state, is activated, and announces the SAME state afterwards.
 *
 * ## Why this is a rule and not the model's, reversing a decision recorded above
 *
 * The comment above says a rule here "would duplicate a decision that already holds", because
 * `4.1.2:state-change-silent` is model-owned and scores 59/0/0 on development. That reasoning weighed only
 * ACCURACY, and the two layers differ in something else entirely: what they are PERMITTED TO CLAIM.
 *
 * A model finding carries no `mapping`, which `RequirementMapping` defines as `secondary` — so
 * `criterionOutcomes` reports it `cantTell`, "needs human confirmation". A rule may be CONFORMANCE-mapped
 * and assert. How often the tool asserts wrongly on real pages, and how often it refers, is published with its date,
 * population and run in README's claim block (#1579), and deliberately not restated here: a count written in a
 * comment goes stale unseen, which is how this one did.
 *
 * And `compare-layers.mjs` names this exact criterion as the differentiator against a static scanner —
 * "axe can see that `aria-expanded` EXISTS; it cannot see that it never CHANGES". So the one finding this
 * project makes that nothing else can was being reported as a maybe, while a deterministic rule for it had
 * already been written and measured at 69/69 EXACT with no false positives across 1,001 conformant records.
 *
 * The ownership rule — exactly one layer decides each subtype — is sound and stays. What it lacked was the
 * observation that "which layer is more accurate" and "which layer may state a conclusion" are different
 * questions, and that a subtype whose evidence is DECISIVE belongs with the layer that can act on it.
 *
 * ## Why the evidence is decisive
 *
 * `probeDisclosure` calls `nvda.act()` and only then reads the state, so `after` is post-activation. A
 * control that said `collapsed`, was activated, and still says `collapsed` has contradicted itself. There
 * is no second reading of that: either the state did not change, or it changed and was not announced, and
 * both are 4.1.2 failures for the same user.

/**
 * 3.3.3 Error Suggestion — the error IS announced, and names only the problem.
 *
 * A RULE rather than a head, and the reason is measured. A head was trained for this subtype and had
 * **recall 0.0 on its own training data** under both poolings, with false positives on conformant
 * records — see `known-gaps.md` §22. The distinction is one clause inside a long announcement, which a
 * document average dilutes and an instance max did not rescue.
 *
 * It does not need a head. This project's doctrine is that rules ASSERT what can be READ directly and the
 * scorer TRIAGES judgements, and "does the announced error contain an instruction?" is read directly —
 * the same basis on which `1.1.1:filename-alt` is rules-owned. The signal discriminated 44 captured pairs
 * with no errors while the head could not fit 15.
 *
 * THREE PRECONDITIONS, and each exists because its absence is a different criterion's finding:
 *
 *   - a submit must have HAPPENED. No activation means the probe never ran, and reading that as "no
 *     remedy" would make every capture without a form a 3.3.3 failure.
 *   - an error must have been ANNOUNCED. Silence is 3.3.1's finding, not this one, and asserting both
 *     from one page is how `errorVariant`'s first fixture taught the 3.3.2 head about validation
 *     messages.
 *   - the remedy is matched as an INSTRUCTION, never a sentiment. A vocabulary of "good words" is
 *     `vague_link_present` in a new costume; removing that feature took 2.4.4 from 27 false positives to
 *     0 precisely because it answered a different question with a wordlist.
 *
 * NO PUNCTUATION in the pattern. NVDA speaks "e.g." as "e dot g." and "DD/MM/YYYY" as "DD slash MM slash
 * YYYY", so an alternative leaning on a symbol can never match an announcement — it looks like coverage
 * and matches nothing. Measured; it cost a chain run.

 * defaulted here. The observation is a TIMING/sequencing read over CDP, not a read of whether a focus
 * indicator was ever drawn; F55 is the reasoned conclusion from it (nothing can hold a visible indicator
 * if nothing holds focus), and that inference is exactly the gap `secondary` exists to mark. Also
 * unruled-out: the other listed failure, F78 (styling an indicator away), which this evidence says
 * nothing about either way — a clean report here is silent on F78, never a pass for 2.4.7 as a whole.
 *
 * THIS RULE DID NOT EXIST UNTIL 2026-09-06, and it went through two designs the same night before this
 * one, each refuted by a real capture:
 *
 * - The ORIGINAL capture-side verdict paired `focusin(X)`→`focusout(X)` within a synchronous window and
 *   called that F55 unconditionally. `keyboard-trap-modal-escape.good`, CONFORMANT, refuted it: its log
 *   holds two such pairs at 0ms — a modal correctly claiming focus for its first field, and the tab ring
 *   correctly wrapping — and BOTH landed on a different real control (id 1, "House number") within 0-1ms.
 *   F55's own text (w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F55) is explicit that every example is a
 *   destination-less `.blur()` and the mechanism "removes focus from the content ENTIRELY" — redirecting
 *   focus to a real destination is not this failure, however fast.
 * - A SECOND capture-side revision added a destination check, but still only recognised COMPLETED pairs.
 *   `focus-removed-on-receipt-order.bad`, one of this criterion's own NINE POSITIVES, refuted that too:
 *   its real failure is an ORPHANED `focusout` — "Delivery instructions" appears in the log only as a
 *   focusout, twice, with no matching `focusin` ever recorded, because the script intercepts so fast the
 *   browser's own focus event never completes. A rule keyed on completed pairs cannot see this at all: it
 *   is not a pair that arrived late, it is one that never formed. Measured against the exported corpus,
 *   both designs together: 0 of 9 positives caught while firing on 10 conformant records.
 *
 * So the decision needs the FULL sequence, walked here rather than pre-digested at capture time (`log`'s
 * own field doc) — captures record, rules decide (ADR 0021). For every `focusout`:
 *
 * 1. Is it a COMPLETED receipt (the immediately preceding event is a `focusin` on the same id) or an
 *    ORPHANED one (anything else)? An orphaned focusout has no `heldMs` to measure and is reported as one
 *    regardless of what follows — the missing `focusin` IS the signal, per the worked example above.
 * 2. A completed receipt is only worth reporting if the hold was script-fast (`FOCUS_SCRIPT_WINDOW_MS`) —
 *    an ordinary Tab transition's `focusout(A)` is caused by the NEXT Tab press, measured at a
 *    633ms-to-1,944ms floor, two orders of magnitude slower.
 * 3. EITHER shape is cleared if focus landed on a different real control within the same script tick
 *    (`focusLandedOnADifferentControl`) — the trap/dialog-redirect case above. Landing on itself, landing
 *    too slowly (the probe's own later Tab press, an unrelated recovery), or nothing following at all are
 *    all still F55.
 *
 * THE PREDICATE MUST NOT MISREAD CONTAINING FOCUS AS RELOCATING IT — "focus trap" is two different
 * mechanisms and only one of them can ever trip this rule. RELOCATING traps (the synthetic modal above)
 * move focus programmatically on `focusin`, which is exactly the 0ms pair this rule reads. CONTAINING
 * traps (a real cookie banner's usual shape) hold focus by tab order and DOM position alone — nothing
 * moves focus on receipt, so no such pair exists and this rule is correctly silent on them already, not
 * silent by accident. Confirmed 2026-09-06 on three real pages whose consent dialogs are exactly this
 * shape, fetched at protocol 15 specifically to check: `design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/`
 * (296 events), `.../components/radios/` (222 events), `check-for-flooding.service.gov.uk/river-and-sea-
 * levels` (54 events) — hundreds of real focus transitions between them, zero findings. Do not "fix" that
 * silence into firing; it is CONTAINING working as intended, not a gap.
 *
 * ANY 2.4.7 FINDING ON A REAL PAGE MUST BE READ INDIVIDUALLY AGAINST ITS STORED LOG before it is treated
 * as a false positive or absorbed into a baseline — a page that genuinely strips focus with no destination
 * is a real F55 whoever published it, and the baseline must not learn to ignore that any more than it must
 * learn to accuse a conformant redirect. The stored `log` (not a capture-time count) is what makes reading
 * one individually possible at all.
 *
 * `checked: false` means the oracle could not run — reported nowhere, per `focusEvents`' own contract:
 * "cannot say", never "no findings". Only a real `checked: true` reading is examined, and even then a
 * cleared or empty log is a real zero, not an absence.

 * 4.1.2 — a FRAME with no accessible name.
 *
 * The completion of the protocol-11 frame sweep, and without it that sweep produced evidence nothing
 * decided on. `rules:gate` said so directly: *"4.1.2:unnamed-control is rule-decided on 236 record(s) and
 * caught only 227"*, naming `iframe-unnamed.bad` and its variants — a case labelled for a rules-owned
 * subtype whose rule could not see its defect.
 *
 * IT CANNOT REUSE `addUnnamedControls`, and the reason is structural rather than an oversight. NVDA
 * announces a frame as CONTEXT, so `parseAnnouncement` puts it in `containers` while that function walks
 * `objects`. Verified rather than assumed:
 *
 *     "Booking options, frame, ..."  ->  containers [{name: "Booking options", role: "frame"}]
 *     "frame, ..."                   ->  containers [{name: "", role: "frame"}]
 *
 * This repo fixed the mirror of this three days ago — *"a landmark's name is in `containers`, not
 * `objects` — §11 was my bug"* — and it is the same shape read from the other end.
 *
 * ASSERTED, not referred, because the evidence is unambiguous in a way a combo box's is not. A frame's
 * name has no value to be confused with: NVDA either prefixes one or it does not, and there is no second
 * reading of an empty one. That is why `addUnnamedControls` needs its `ambiguous` escape and this does
 * not.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS TO A USER, which is the test for whether a rule earns its place: a frame is announced on
 * entry and then not again. An unnamed one tells a screen-reader user only that they have entered
 * something, with no way to know what is inside before committing to reading it.

  // cycles. That is 2.1.2 read literally — focus must be movable away "using only a keyboard", and
  // activating a button in the ring is exactly that, whereas a ring of bare text fields has no such move.

  // A ROLE TEST, NOT A WORDLIST. It asks `parseAnnouncement` for the role and never looks at the words, so
  // it cannot become the 2.4.4 shortcut — a feature answering a different question, taken because it was
  // the cheapest separator available. It would behave identically on a banner written in any language.

  // NON-INTERFERENCE under WCAG 5.2.5, so a wrong accusation says the whole page is unusable.

 * reporting the link's own state, which is not silence and names nothing about where the user now is. So
 * the rule would have been silent on the page it was written for. What actually separates the failure is
 * that the VIEW MOVED while the title stood still.
 *
 * That also handles the probe's real limitation. It activates the first link on the page, which on a real
 * site may be a skip link or a plain fragment jump — and then the heading does not change either, so this
 * correctly makes no claim.
 *
 * #253: "the first heading changed" is a proxy for "the document moved", and three ordinary page shapes
 * defeat it identically — a consent overlay switching panels, a link that opens a new tab (2.4.2 is
 * structurally inapplicable there), and a modal opening. `act-rules.ts` already maps this ACT rule
 * `secondary` (a REFERRAL, `cantTell`, never an assertion — a fact the row that opened this section
 * initially read wrong, conflating `decidedBy: "rules"`, which is about OWNERSHIP, with conformance
 * mapping, which is independent; see `rule-ownership.json`'s note). So the fix here is not about
 * downgrading an assertion that does not exist — it is about not spending a person's attention on a
 * referral that is really page furniture. `OPENS_ELSEWHERE` and the `dialog`-container check below narrow
 * on evidence NVDA itself reads (the link's own announcement; a container role in `CONTAINER_ROLES`),
 * never on inferring a page shape from its content. #142 remains the only path to a general fix: this
 * narrows two of the three known shapes and does not claim to close the class.

 *
 *   FIXED — `focusLossVerdict` (2.4.7, `addFocusEventFindings`). `FocusLogEvent` already carries a real
 *   `atMs` per entry that the evidence string dropped; two genuinely separate focusout events on the same
 *   control 26ms apart produced identical text. `atMs` is now folded into the evidence itself, which folds
 *   it into this key for free — verified against the V1 rehearsal's own log (`rules.test.ts`, "#811: two
 *   genuinely distinct focusout events...").
 *
 *   NOT FIXED, evidence is already complete — `addImageAlternatives`, `addUnnamedControls` (both
 *   channels), `addUnnamedFrames`, `addVagueLinks`: evidence IS the full announced/transcript line, so two
 *   entries colliding means the real announced text was identical, not that a fact was dropped. (Frames
 *   truncate that line to 80 chars, which is a real but DIFFERENT defect — evidence LOSS by truncation,
 *   not an unfolded occurrence fact — and is out of this row's scope.)
 *
 *   NOT FIXED, no real fact to fold in — `addSilentStateChanges` (4.1.2 state-change-silent),
 *   `addAutoplayingAudio` (1.4.2), and `addUnidentifiedInputPurpose` (1.3.5, #869): all three iterate a SET
 *   of distinct probed elements (one activation attempt per disclosure control; one entry per
 *   `<audio>`/`<video>` tag; one entry per form control), and none of their underlying types carries any
 *   per-entry id, index or timestamp at all (`{control?, after?}[]`; `{tag, autoplay, muted, controls,
