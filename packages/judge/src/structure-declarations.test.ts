/**
 * ONE DECLARATION OF WHAT A CAPTURE'S `structure` IS — known-gaps §15.
 *
 * It was declared independently in five places, and they disagreed. `JudgeInput` omitted `graphics` while
 * `addUnnamedGraphics` read it, and nothing noticed, because OBJECT SPREAD PRESERVES WHAT A TYPE DOES NOT
 * MENTION: the runtime was unaffected and the type understated what flows, so a caller building the
 * literal by hand would silently have starved the rule.
 *
 * Each declaration is now `CaptureStructure`, `Pick<>` or `Partial<>` of it, so a consumer that reads a
 * genuine subset still says so — no rule reads `landmarks`, and declaring it would claim a capability that
 * does not exist — while none of them can name a field the wire does not carry.
 *
 * `tsc` enforces the derivation itself (a `Pick` of a key that is not on `CaptureStructure` does not
 * compile). What it CANNOT see is somebody writing a fresh inline object type, which is exactly how the
 * five copies arose — so this test reads for that shape.
