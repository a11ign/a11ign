 * Which judge to use. **The default is `local`: this project's OWN trained scorer.**

 * It used to default to `codex`, and that was wrong in a way that quietly undermined every gate. The
 * whole point of training a screen-reader scorer was to stop renting an LLM's opinion, and the GitHub
 * Action already shipped `judge-backend: local` — but `npm run eval` and `npm run eval:gate` inherited
 * this default, so **judge quality was measured on a rented model and never once on ours**. A gate that
 * does not exercise what ships is not a gate.
 *
 * Flipping it also changed what those gates report, and the changes were real defects rather than noise:
 * running the fixtures through our own model found a starved-model false-positive storm on seven
 * conformant fixtures, and a crash on an out-of-scope capture. Both were invisible to `codex`, which only
 * ever reads the transcript.
 *
 * The other backends stay available and are never the default. They are for comparison and research —
 * `codex` uses a local subscription login (no metered cost), `anthropic` and `openai` need the caller's
 * own key. The backend is one clean seam: evidence in, findings out.

// Stage 1 — RECALL. Find everything; ignore the task; over-include on purpose.
// Decoupling the audit from "could the user finish the task" is what stops a
// completable page from suppressing its own real findings.
const RECALL_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are auditing a screen-reader transcript: the ordered list of what a screen reader actually announced while reading a web page in browse mode.

Your ONLY job here is RECALL. List EVERY potential accessibility problem you can find. Work through the transcript line by line. Be exhaustive and over-inclusive: a later step verifies and filters, so it is better to include a borderline issue than to miss one.

Do NOT consider whether the user could complete any task. That is irrelevant to this list.

Look especially for:
- Images or graphics announced with no meaningful name: "Unlabelled graphic", or a filename or junk string instead of a description.
- Links whose text does not convey their purpose: "Click here", "Read more", "link" with no name, or a bare URL.
- Visual section titles announced as plain text instead of "heading level N" (missing heading semantics).
- Form fields or controls announced without a clear label, or with a confusing name.
- Text or phone numbers presented as graphics.
- Data tables: if the cells in data rows are announced WITHOUT their row or column header (for example "column 2, 09:15" rather than "Departs, column 2, 09:15"), the header cells are not programmatically associated. If each data cell IS announced with its header, the table is fine.
- Use structural navigation as corroborating evidence, not as a finding by itself. If the ordered transcript already announces a heading or landmark role, do NOT report a failure merely because the structural-navigation list omits it: that pass can be incomplete. If the transcript contains several clear section-title lines interleaved with body text, but none are announced as headings, that supports 1.3.1. A single plain sentence—including a sentence that sounds like a section title—is not enough to establish missing heading semantics unless another direct signal identifies it as a visual heading. Likewise, "Landmarks/regions: NONE found" alone is not a WCAG failure without direct evidence of distinct regions that should be landmarks. A form field listed without a name there is unlabelled (3.3.2 / 4.1.2) only when it is actually a field, not merely a button.
- When a line contains the U+FFFC replacement marker ("￼"), treat it as an NVDA/Guidepup element-boundary artifact. It is not an unlabelled graphic when it follows a named control such as "Email address, edit, ￼". Flag it only when the role/name is otherwise absent, for example a bare "graphic, ￼".
- Form and dynamic-interaction probe fields are diagnostic context, not proof that every activated control is an invalid form submission. Do not invent 3.3.1 or 4.1.3 errors for ordinary named buttons. A dynamic result-change probe can support 4.1.3 only when the transcript/context shows that a user-triggered status or result count changed but the empty announcement failed to convey it.
- Do not treat status/weather lines such as "Traffic:" or "Today:" as headings merely because they are short plain text. Do not flag a link such as "full story" when the immediately associated heading or excerpt identifies the article. Do not flag an image-only unnamed link under 2.4.4 solely because its graphic lacks a name when 1.1.1/4.1.2 already describe the direct problem.
- Anything announced in a confusing or illogical order.
- A named combo box/action pair such as "Quick Menu, button, Go" has meaningful control context; do not flag its short action word under 2.4.6. A single content label such as "Artichoke advice telephone hotline:" is not evidence of missing heading semantics when it follows an announced section heading; do not turn labels into headings. Likewise, an isolated trailing value after an otherwise coherent table or list is not evidence of 1.3.2 without direct context showing that the value is out of sequence.
- An empty generic probe after an ordinary named action such as "Save changes" or "Search" is not a status-message failure. Require direct context that the action changes a result, count, validation state, or other user-relevant status before applying 4.1.3.

The transcript is read line by line, so a single long heading, link, or sentence can be split across consecutive lines. Treat consecutive lines that continue a phrase, or that repeat the same role such as "heading, level 1", as ONE element. Do NOT report "split", "fragmented", or "broken-up" headings or links that are only an element wrapping across lines: that is not an accessibility problem.

This applies to what you conclude, not only to how you word it. JOIN the fragments and judge the joined element. When a line ENDS with "link, <word>" and the next line BEGINS with "link, <word>", that is one link whose text wrapped — read it as the concatenation before asking whether its purpose is clear. Concretely, "link, document" ending one line and "link, use" starting the next is the single link "document use", which is descriptive; reporting "document" and "use" as two links with unclear destinations is the same error as calling them fragmented, and is wrong for the same reason. Standard footer boilerplate ("liability", "trademark", "document use", "software licensing", "privacy policy") names a specific policy document and is not vague link text.

For each problem, quote the exact transcript line(s) that evidence it.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object, nothing else:
{"issues": [{"issue": string, "evidence": string}]}`;

// Stage 2 — GROUND + VERIFY. Assign the precise criterion, drop the unsupported,
// judge the task SEPARATELY so it cannot delete a finding.
const VERIFY_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are an expert accessibility auditor finalizing a report. A first pass produced a list of CANDIDATE issues found in a screen-reader transcript. Your job is to GROUND and FINALIZE them, not to second-guess whether problems exist.

For EACH candidate, produce a finding UNLESS it is clearly spurious or clearly not a WCAG 2.2 Level A or AA matter. Default to KEEPING it; when in doubt, keep it.

For each finding you keep:
- Cite the single most precise success criterion FROM THE PROVIDED LIST, using its exact number and name. Do not cite any criterion that is not in the list.
- Quote the transcript evidence (you may reuse the candidate's evidence).
- Assign severity (blocker, serious, moderate, or minor) and a calibrated confidence from 0 to 1.

Rules:
- Keep distinct problems SEPARATE. Unlabelled or junk-described images (1.1.1), vague link text such as "Click here" / "Read more" / a bare "news" (2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)), and visual titles not announced as "heading level N" (1.3.1 Info and Relationships) are different findings. Do not collapse them into one.
- Only merge candidates that are literally the same issue repeated, into a single finding that notes the recurrence.
- A "Click here" or "Read more" link fails 2.4.4 UNLESS the immediately surrounding announced text makes its destination clear. A vague link beside unrelated text still fails.
- Text or phone numbers shown as a graphic are 1.1.1 (and, if they convey readable text, 1.4.5 Images of Text).
- The transcript is read line by line, so one heading, link, or sentence may wrap across consecutive lines. Do NOT create a finding for a "split", "fragmented", or "broken-up" heading or link that is merely line-wrapping (for example, consecutive "heading, level 1, ..." lines that form one title). Line-wrapping is not a WCAG failure.
- Flag 1.3.1 Info and Relationships ONLY when structure is announced WITHOUT its semantics: a visual section title read as plain text with no "heading" role, or missing list/table relationships. A heading-level skip (for example level 1 then level 4) is NOT a 1.3.1 failure. If headings, lists, and landmarks ARE announced with their roles, do not raise 1.3.1.
- A control announced with descriptive text (for example "Change Text Size or Colors") HAS an accessible name, even if the word "link" or "button" does not appear on the same transcript line, and even if it also appears compressed elsewhere (such as a skip-link or controls landmark read at the top of the page). Do NOT flag it under 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value or 2.4.6 Headings and Labels. Reserve 4.1.2 for controls announced by ROLE ONLY with no name: a bare "button", "link", "graphic", or "edit text" with no accompanying text.
- Treat structural navigation as corroborating evidence, not as an independent oracle. If the ordered transcript announces a heading or landmark role, do NOT report a failure merely because the structural list omits it. Report missing heading semantics only when the transcript itself shows several clear, title-like sections announced as plain text, or another direct signal explicitly identifies a plain-text line as a visual heading. An isolated plain sentence or an ambiguous structural-list mismatch is insufficient. Report missing landmarks only when the transcript/context directly establishes distinct regions that should be landmarks; "Landmarks/regions: NONE found" alone is insufficient.
- Do not infer a missing selection, pressed, or expanded state from a static list of otherwise named controls. For example, "button, All, button, Shoes, button, Bags" does not establish a 4.1.2 failure: require an explicitly announced state, or an interaction re-read showing a state is absent or unchanged after activation. A candidate that calls this only a "potential" state problem is spurious.
- The character "￼" (U+FFFC) is an NVDA/Guidepup element-boundary marker. It is not evidence of an unlabelled graphic when it follows a named control or field, such as "Email address, edit, ￼" or "Email, radio button, not checked, ￼". Flag it only when the role/name is otherwise absent, such as a standalone "graphic, ￼".
- Probe metadata about form submission and control activation does not mean that every activated button is an invalid form. Apply 3.3.1 only to an actual form field whose post-submit announcement lacks an error or invalid state. Apply 4.1.3 to an empty post-action announcement only when the page/context clearly requires a user-triggered status or result update; do not flag ordinary named buttons or controls merely because their generic probe delta is empty. A positive announcement such as a changed result count satisfies the status requirement.
- Context matters for link purpose: "full story" can be sufficiently clear when immediately associated with an announced article heading or excerpt. Do not flag status/weather lines such as "Traffic:" or "Today:" as headings merely because they are short plain text. Do not add 2.4.4 solely because an image-only link also has an unnamed graphic when the direct evidence is already covered by 1.1.1/4.1.2. Do not treat a repeated landmark/content-info announcement or a named landmark/form name as a reading-order or headings-and-labels failure by itself.
- Keep a candidate only when its evidence directly establishes a WCAG A or AA failure. Do not turn "may", "potentially", generic structural absence, a heading-level skip, a duplicate caused by a landmark announcement, or a U+FFFC marker into a finding.
- Do not flag 2.4.6 for a short action word like "Go" when the control is explicitly announced with a meaningful context/name such as "Quick Menu". Do not flag 1.3.1 for a single descriptive content label such as "Artichoke advice telephone hotline:"; that is a label, not a proven visual heading. Do not flag 1.3.2 from a solitary trailing value after a coherent table or list unless the transcript directly establishes that the value is out of sequence.
- Do not flag 4.1.3 when the only evidence is an empty generic probe after an ordinary named action such as "Save changes" or "Search" and no result, count, validation, or other status change is shown.
