/**
 * EVERY module that runs the rules against a capture must extract the oracle counts with `oracleCounts`.
 *
 * This is a DISCOVERY test, not a list, for the reason `worker-code-check.test.ts` gives: a list records
 * the callers that existed when somebody last looked. The census defect has now been found three separate
 * times in this repo — two audits (2026-08-26), then `calibrate-abstention` and `rules-check` (2026-08-28)
 * — and each time the fix reached the callers in front of whoever was looking and no others. A seventh
 * caller fails this test until somebody classifies it.
 *
 * Both directions are failures, and the second is worse:
 *
 *   - A caller that SKIPS the extraction runs census-reading rules against a capture that records the
 *     census as a diagnostic, so those rules return on their first line. `calibrate-abstention` did this
 *     in the one sweep that scores real pages through the product path.
 *   - A caller that has evidence the PRODUCT does not build makes a rule that is exercised by a gate and
 *     silent for users. `dom` was exported and nowhere else, so the first rule to read it would have
 *     scored perfectly on 1,183 conformant records and never once fired. Nothing would have said so.
