/**
 * WHY each WCAG 2.2 AA criterion is or is not assessed — all 55, in one place.
 *
 * `coverage.ts` answers WHICH criteria ship. This answers WHY the rest do not, and what each would
 * take. That distinction is the whole point: `criterionOutcomes` returns every uncovered criterion as
 * `untested`, one
 * undifferentiated bucket in which "impossible from assistive-technology evidence" (1.4.3 Contrast) and
 * "trivial, the data is already on disk" (2.4.2 Page Titled) look identical. For anyone deciding what to
 * build next, that is the only distinction that matters.
 *
 * It also records PARTIAL coverage, which nothing else could express. 4.1.2 is assessed, and a role-less
 * `<div onclick>` is not assessable at all from screen-reader evidence. Reported at criterion granularity
 * that page reads as fine; it is not.
 *
 * That sentence used to say "one of its three failure modes", and 4.1.2's own entry said the same. Both
 * were wrong in the same way, which is why this is stated in one place now: the criterion has three
 * CLAUSES, and the role-less div is a second failure mode of the FIRST one (no role), not a third clause.
 * Counting it as the third made the entry read as covering the whole criterion bar one gap. See 4.1.2.
 *
 * Pinned by `criterion-coverage.test.ts` against `WCAG_22_AA` and `assessedCriteria()`, so it cannot
 * drift from what ships in either direction: a criterion that starts being assessed and is still recorded
 * as unreachable fails the test, and so does the reverse.
 *
 * **A SECOND boundary this file did not record until 2026-08-22, and it cuts across every entry below.**
 *
 * Where a subtype is decided by a deterministic RULE (`packages/lab/rule-ownership.json`), the answer is
 * exact and the trained head is suppressed for it. Where the head decides alone, the answer inherits the
 * head's blind spots — and those are measured: `npm run scorer:shortcuts` counts **225 features a head
 * penalises for free**, because they are 0 on every one of its training positives and therefore cost
 * nothing to learn. A page carrying such a feature can go silent on a criterion it genuinely fails.
 *
 * So `status: "assessed"` means "we have evidence and a decider", never "this answer is exact". Which it
 * is depends on the owner, and **`packages/lab/rule-ownership.json` is where that is declared** — read it
 * there rather than here.
 *
 * This paragraph used to enumerate them, and by 2026-08-29 the list said "the nine subtypes the head
 * decides alone", listed TEN, and named several that had since moved to the rules — `4.1.2:state-change-
 * silent` among them, which ADR 0021 moved deliberately and which this file went on citing as head-owned.
 * A prose copy of a machine-readable fact, in the file whose entire purpose is honesty about coverage.
 *
 * The shape is what is worth stating, because it is stable and the membership is not: `rules` (exact,
 * measured at 0 false positives across 1,183 conformant records), `overlap` (the rules cover a deliberate
 * subset and the head owns the rest), and `unavailable` — **nobody decides it**, which is a stronger claim
 * than "the head decides it alone" and the one the old list obscured. `subtype-ownership.test.ts` pins the
 * counts so this can drift no further. See
 * `docs/adr/0015-one-defect-per-page-taught-the-scorer-to-veto.md`.
 *
 * **`needs` is a claim about EVIDENCE, not about difficulty.** It says which source could decide the
 * criterion, and the honest ordering is that `screen-reader` items are reachable with a probe,
 * `accessibility-tree` items with the CDP socket the capture already opens, `dom` items only by crossing
 * the boundary that keeps the model honest (a deterministic rule may, a trained head may not -- see
 * `modelInput()`'s allowlist), and `visual` / `human` / `multi-page` items not by this tool at all.

An error a screen reader cannot reach is not one where 'the item that is in error is identified' for that user, and `input error` is defined as 'Information provided by the user that is not accepted'. It REFERS rather than asserts: `rule-ownership.json` does not claim this criterion for the rule layer, so it is model-decided, sets no `mapping` and reports `cantTell`.

And real-page grounding is a SEPARATE, still-open claim: corpus coverage widening is not licence to call this criterion `assessed` -- `build-realism` still reports `4.1.3: 0 of 39` on real pages (#32), because `postSubmitFields`/`formChanges` remain absent from the real corpus as captured. WHICH CHANNEL ANSWERS IT MATTERS, because the criterion says status messages must be presented 'WITHOUT RECEIVING FOCUS'. `formChanges[].after` is the speech delta `activateAndCaptureDelta` takes immediately after the activation and before any navigation, so it is speech the page produced on its own — that is the evidence. `postSubmitFields` is a RE-READ reached by navigating to the fields, so text found there proves only that it exists somewhere reachable: a page with no live region at all announces its error on re-read. `post_submit_present` reads that channel and is available to the head, so treat it as corroboration, never as evidence that this criterion is met.

Over every capture on disk where the deterministic rule layer actually reports a 4.1.2 finding (218 of 2,178 synthetic, 3 of 28 real-page), isolating exactly one candidate channel and re-running the rule reproduced the SAME finding from `formFields` alone (148), `controls` alone (148 -- heavily redundant with `formFields`, since the same control usually appears in both the sweep and the interaction probe), `stateChanges` alone (69 -- `state-change-silent` needs no form-field or control announcement at all), or `frames` alone (1 -- an unnamed iframe, which only the frame sweep carries). No capture needed more than one. The old `channels` list (`controls`, `formFields`, `stateChanges`, `structureCensus`) combined with `criteriaAssessableFrom`'s default ALL-of semantic reported 4.1.2 BLOCKED on 146 of those 218 captures -- including CONFORMANCE-mapped, asserted findings -- because most pages exercise only one of the two rule-owned subtypes, never both, and `structureCensus` was NEVER load-bearing at all (ablating it changed 0 of 218 outcomes; `assertableSweep`'s own design already treats unknown completeness as assertable, so census absence never withheld an assertion). `transcript` was never independently sufficient in the sample (0/221) but `addUnnamedControls(input.transcript, \"transcript\", add)` genuinely reads it, so it stays a fifth disjunct rather than being dropped on an absence. `EVIDENCE_CHANNEL[\"4.1.2\"]` was corrected the same way and the two are pinned equal by `channel-tables-4.1.2.test.ts`. `SWEEPS_FEEDING[\"4.1.2\"] = [\"formField\"]` is UNCHANGED and deliberately narrower: it answers a different question (which SWEEP-typed channel can TRUNCATE, for the cantTell-on-truncation guard), and `stateChanges`/`controls`/`frames` have no comparable step-cap truncation concept to guard. THE CRITERION HAS THREE CLAUSES AND THIS ENTRY USED TO ENUMERATE TWO OF THEM AS THREE. Verbatim: \"the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available\". CLAUSE 1 (name/role) is covered for the NAME half -- a control announced with a role and no name, rules-owned and exact on 147 records. Its other half, a role-less `<div onclick>` styled as a button, is NOT covered and cannot be from screen-reader evidence: the screen reader cannot perceive it, which IS the failure, so a page with a fake button and a page with no button are identical to NVDA. Declared `unavailable` in rule-ownership.json; `hasEvidenceFor('4.1.2')` also suppresses any finding on such a page, since it requires controls to exist. CLAUSE 3 (notification of changes) is covered by `state-change-silent`, RULES-owned since ADR 0021 and measured 69/0/0 across 144 captures carrying state evidence. CLAUSE 2 (settability) IS NOT COVERED AND IS NOT REACHABLE HERE, which is the part this note previously did not say at all. It asks whether an assistive technology can programmatically SET a value the user can set -- a question about the UIA/IA2 surface (a ValuePattern, a TogglePattern), not about anything NVDA says. Our capture drives NVDA, which operates controls by EMULATING THE KEYBOARD, so `probeArrows` and `probeTyping` witness operability rather than settability; a control the AT cannot set presents as one that does not respond, which is 2.1.1's failure and indistinguishable from it in speech. So the gap is structural rather than a corpus gap, and no new case closes it. THE TWO COVERED HALVES ARE BOTH RULE-DECIDED and therefore exact -- this note used to call `state-change-silent` \"head-decided\" carrying 18 free vetoes, which ADR 0021 stopped being true on 2026-08-24. The head's own score on an unnamed control is poor (the identical announcement scores 0.9240 on a page without a table and 0.4525 on one with), but neither mode reaches a report through the head, because the rules own both. See ADR 0015 and ADR 0021.",

  // ---- reachable from evidence we already have, or could capture -------------------------------
  // MEASURED 2026-08-21. First conclusion was "cheap to build, worthless to ship" on the strength of
  // "zero failures in 4,895 captures" — and that number proves nothing, because NEITHER population can
  // produce the fault:
  //
  //   - the 4,822 corpus captures come from `page()` in case-matrix.mjs, which hardcodes `<title>`, so a
  //     titleless generated page is impossible BY CONSTRUCTION;
  //   - the 77 real captures are UK public-sector pages, the most templated and most audited on the web.
  //
  // That is this repo's own "a canary that cannot express the fault is worthless" rule, applied to the
  // criterion when it belonged to the measurement. The evidence was never the problem: the title is
  // captured reliably, with an `ok` flag, on 98.3% of everything on disk.
  //
  // The claim survives on THIRD-PARTY data instead. WebAIM's 2026 Million report tests 1,000,000 home pages
  // and names six categories covering 96% of all errors — contrast 83.9%, alt text 53.1%, form labels 51%,
  // empty links 46.3%, empty buttons 30.6%, document LANGUAGE 13.5%. Missing document TITLE is not among
  // them, and since they do measure document-level attributes, title absence sits well below 13.5%.
  //
  // The evidence is genuinely there — 4,818 of 4,899 corpus captures and 77 of 77 real ones carry a
  // `documentReady` diagnostic with NVDA's SPOKEN title, and the 81 without have `ok: false`, so "we could
  // not measure" is distinguishable from "the page has no title". That distinction is the one this criterion
  // would live or die on.
  //
  // What killed it is the failure rate. The detectable subset is ABSENCE — no title, or a placeholder like
  // "Untitled" or "index.html" — and across 4,895 measurable captures there are **zero** of either. Every
  // CMS template on earth emits a title.
  //
  // And the documented failures are the other kind. W3C's own report for the BAD survey page lists 2.4.2 as
  // "page title doesn't describe content", yet the page's actual title is
  // "Welcome to CityLights! [Inaccessible Survey Page]" — descriptive by any reading. Whether a title
  // describes its topic is human judgement, the same wall 2.4.6 stops at.
  //
  // So a rule here would fire only on pages authored to trip it, and would add a row to this table without
  // adding any detection. That is the "canary that cannot express the fault" shape, sold as coverage.

[Inaccessible Survey Page]'). What IS assessed, since 2026-08-22, is the single-page-app transition: `probeNavigation` activates a navigation control and asks NVDA for the page title before and after, and `addStaleRouteTitle` reports a route that moved while the title stood still. A static analyser cannot reach this at all — the markup is valid at every instant and the failure is the TRANSITION. Two known limits: the probe activates the FIRST link, which on a real site may be a skip link (then the heading does not change either and the rule correctly makes no claim), and the corroborating signal is deliberately NOT 'nothing was announced' — measured, the failing page announced 'visited'." },

Whether a mechanism exists is a DOM fact the static layer answers better than our landmark sweep, which is documented as nondeterministic; same call as 3.1.1, where the attribute is the fact. What is assessed is a mechanism that is present and INERT: `probeNavigation` activates the first link and records where one Tab lands immediately afterwards, and `addInertSkipLink` fires when that is exactly where the ordinary tab order would have gone anyway. Measured on a pair differing only in the target id: 'Search the archive, edit' against 'News and updates, link'. A checker sees a link and a plausible href and passes the page." },

Whether an order 'preserves meaning' in general stays human judgement, the wall 2.4.6 also stops at, so this covers the contradiction case only. Worth noting what the measured failure looks like: positive `tabindex` did not pull the fields to the FRONT of the traversal, it displaced them past every link to the end — a user tabbing the form reaches Notes, then six unrelated links, then Postcode." },

POSITIONAL, because the focus probe truncates at 12 stops on every corpus page — absence from `focusOrder` alone would fire almost everywhere, so a control counts as unreachable only when something LATER in reading order was reached. Keyboard operation of a control that is NOT announced, and operation by keys other than Tab, remain outside this. AND SO DOES THE CRITERION'S TIMING CLAUSE, which this note omitted until 2026-09-05 while enumerating the other two exclusions — the omission that makes an enumeration misleading rather than incomplete. Verbatim: functionality must be operable \"WITHOUT REQUIRING SPECIFIC TIMINGS FOR INDIVIDUAL KEYSTROKES\", which W3C explains as keystrokes that must be repeated \"within a short period of time\" or a key \"held down for an extended period\". That is a DISTINCT failure from unreachability — keyboard access exists and the demand is temporal — and it is invisible here for a structural reason rather than a corpus one: the focus probe presses Tab once per stop and measures nothing about how long or how fast, so a control needing three keystrokes in 500 ms is reached, announced, and looks entirely conformant." },

F55 is the other: \"using script to remove focus when focus is received\", which fails this criterion because nothing holds focus for an indicator to be drawn on -- not a pixel question, and now assessed. `probeFocusOrder` installs a `focusin`/`focusout` log over CDP, `focusEventVerdict` (`capture-pure.mjs`) pairs same-id events under `FOCUS_SCRIPT_BLUR_WINDOW_MS`, and `addFocusEventFindings` (`rules.ts`) reports it as `secondary` -- a timing pair is evidence the mechanism is absent, not a read of whether an indicator was ever drawn, which is the inference `mapping` exists to mark. `PARTIAL`, not `assessed`: F78 remains entirely unassessed, so a clean report here is silent on it, never a pass for the criterion as a whole. THE REPO ALREADY KNEW F55 FROM THE OTHER END: 3.2.1's rule states it as an unclosed gap and says outright that `focusOrder` could witness it -- ONE PROBE SERVES BOTH CRITERIA, and this is that probe reaching its second consumer. THE AMBIGUITY WAS REAL AND IS NOW DESIGNED FOR: a control that receives focus and has it stripped presents as a control focus never reached, which is 2.1.1's signature -- `focusEventVerdict` matches by element id, never by name or position, precisely so a script-stripped control and a genuinely unreachable one are told apart by the event log rather than by the resulting tab-stop list. THE THRESHOLD'S LOWER BOUND IS UNVERIFIED: `FOCUS_SCRIPT_BLUR_WINDOW_MS`'s own comment (`capture-pure.mjs`) records a 12.6x margin confirmed on the negative side (real ordinary Tab transitions land far above it) and states plainly that no capture has yet recorded a real script `blur()` to confirm one lands under it -- so this channel can currently only ever report a real F55 case correctly, not yet prove it would catch a borderline one.",

A live region updating on a timer is exactly that, and it is the one half a screen reader CAN hear -- so the old reason ruled the criterion out on a property the failing half does not have. Same shape as 1.4.13. It stays out of scope on the half that is audible, for a different reason: the failure is the ABSENCE OF A MECHANISM for that particular region, and relating a control to the region it would pause is a judgement no capture supplies. Observing the updates is unreliable too -- not-working.md \u00a718 measures a polite live region reaching the delta 2 times in 6, unexplained -- so even the audible half cannot be relied on to appear.

So `multi-page` was wrong and is dropped. What remains is genuinely a judgement, and it is the FIRST clause rather than the three bullets: deciding that a page \"causes legal commitments or financial transactions\" or \"modifies or deletes user-controllable data\" is a claim about consequence in the world, which no capture carries.

The criterion governs re-entry \"in the same process\", and W3C puts a process inside one page explicitly -- an email field, then \"confirm your email\", no auto-population, is the textbook failure and entirely one document. The word \"process\" had been read as \"pages\". That correction kept it out of scope on the EXCEPTIONS, assuming they were judgements broad enough to make any rule unsafe. THEY ARE NOT, AND ASSUMING SO WITHOUT READING THEM WAS THE SAME DEFECT ONE LAYER ON. Read: the SECURITY exception explicitly covers password confirmation -- \"having users re-validate their new string is allowed as an exception\" -- and the ESSENTIAL exception is narrow, defined as information whose removal \"would fundamentally change the information or functionality\", with memory games as its only example. **Verifying accuracy does not qualify.** So the common conformant pattern is not a judgement at all, it is one named exception, and NVDA announces a password field distinctly -- the discriminator is in the evidence rather than in a human's head. WHAT IS ACTUALLY MISSING IS A PROBE: nothing today fills one field and asks whether a later one populates, though `probeTyping` already writes to controls. And the mapping should be `secondary` when it is built, not because of the exceptions but because \"these two fields want the same information\" is a LABEL HEURISTIC -- \"Home address\" and \"Billing address\" are similar strings and different information, which is the `vague_link_present` shape that took 2.4.4 to 27 false positives.

W3C is explicit that failures are identifiable from the LOGIN PAGE ITSELF: whether paste is blocked, the form field markup and naming, the presence of a cognitive test, and what alternatives are offered. Blocking paste into a password field is named as a failure outright (F109), and an `onpaste` handler is static DOM -- so this never needed a flow, a second page, or an account. Out of scope for THIS tool for two reasons the old note did not give. First, the detectable half is DOM and produces no assistive-technology signal, which makes it axe-shaped rather than ours. Second, and independently: SECURITY.md forbids the alternative. Deciding whether an \"Alternative\", \"Mechanism\", \"Object Recognition\" or \"Personal Content\" exception applies is a judgement, and `probeForms` already refuses to press buttons on pages we do not own -- attempting an authentication step on a stranger's site is not a review. A wrong reason matters here because \"needs a real flow\" reads as \"do it when we can log in\", and the right answer is that we should not.", },

 * Which criteria this capture can decide, and which it cannot AND WHY.
 *
 * The reason this exists, in one sentence: establishing that 2.4.1, 2.4.3 and 2.1.1 were unvalidatable took
 * an afternoon of walking 4,899 captures over SSH to find that `focusOrder` is absent from every one of them,
 * because `probeFocus` is opt-in and the dataset runner never sets it. This turns that into a call.
 *
 * A criterion needs ALL of its channels by default (`channelMode: "all"`, or unset): 3.3.1 reads
 * `formChanges` and `postSubmitFields` together and a rule with only one of them would be deciding on
 * half the evidence. Where that is too strict for a specific criterion the fix is `channelMode: "any"`
 * on that criterion's own entry — see its doc comment — never to weaken this for every criterion.
 *
 * `out-of-scope` criteria are absent from both lists rather than reported as blocked — nothing is missing,
 * they are simply not this tool's business, and listing them as blocked would imply a probe could fix it.
 *
 * **THIS FUNCTION HAS ZERO PRODUCTION CALLERS, AND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GREP, NOT ASSUMED — 2026-09-06.**
 * `channelsPresent` and `CRITERION_COVERAGE` above it are both live (`audit-rule-coverage.ts`'s
 * `rules:coverage` gate calls `channelsPresent` directly; `docs/coverage.md` is generated from
 * `CRITERION_COVERAGE`), but nothing that ships calls this {assessable, blocked} combinator. It is called
 * only from `criterion-coverage.test.ts` (its own unit tests) and `channel-tables-4.1.2.test.ts` (a
 * real-corpus regression that uses it correctly, as a TEST tool proving the channel tables stay honest —
 * see that file's own header). A peer session spent a night reasoning about a `BLOCKED: 2.4.2 ->
 * routeChange` message as though it were product output; that phrase has only ever appeared in this
 * repo's test-file prose. Kept rather than deleted because it is the tested implementation of the ANY/ALL
 * `channelMode` combinator and `channel-tables-4.1.2.test.ts` depends on it to catch a real regression
 * class (146 of 218 real captures once reported 4.1.2 BLOCKED after an asserted finding); reimplementing
 * that check inline would restate logic this file already owns, the "second copy" shape this repo has
 * paid for repeatedly. `criteria-assessable-from-has-no-production-caller` in `criterion-coverage.test.ts`
 * enforces the claim in this paragraph — if that test ever fails because a real caller was added, this
