/**
 * THE PUBLISHED WIRE TYPES MUST DESCRIBE WHAT A CAPTURE ACTUALLY CARRIES.
 *
 * `@a11ign/evidence`'s `.` subpath is types only — it IS the published description of a capture, and
 * `public-api.test.ts` pins that the subpath resolves. Until 2026-08-29 `CaptureStructure` declared three
 * fields (`headings`, `landmarks`, `formFields`) while every real capture carries SEVEN, and
 * `CaptureInteraction` omitted `focusOrder` entirely. A consumer typing against them would have concluded
 * a capture exposes no links, graphics, lists or table cells.
 *
 * Nothing in this repo used those types, which is why it went unnoticed — they are the API for somebody
 * else. That makes it worse rather than better: the one audience who cannot check the claim is the one it
 * is written for.
 *
 * TWO CHECKS, AND THEY LIVE IN DIFFERENT PLACES. The type conformance below is `tsc`'s — `npx tsx --test`
 * strips types without checking them, so an undeclared field makes the object literal a compile error and
 * the test runner reports nothing at all. Verified by mutation: deleting `links?` from `CaptureStructure`
 * leaves this file green under tsx and fails `tsc --noEmit` with TS2353, which the pre-push hook and CI
 * both run. The first version of this file claimed the runtime lines "stop it being vacuous"; they did not,
 * and that is the defect these tests exist to catch, committed while quoting the rule against it.
 *
 * So the runtime half does the job tsc cannot: it grounds the hand-written list against a REAL capture on
 * disk, because a list I typed out is a claim about the wire and not the wire itself.

/**
 * CAPTURE-CORE.MJS'S OWN JSDoc COPY, PINNED — architecture-audit.md §5, items 1/2, the second of the two
 * permanent exceptions to "one owner". `capture-core.mjs` cannot import `@a11ign/evidence`: it is
 * reachable from every PORTABLE_TREE, and its own `CapturedStructure`/`CapturedInteraction`/`Capture`
 * JSDoc typedefs are what `structure-declarations.test.ts` explicitly does not check — that file's own
 * `sources()` scans `.ts` only (`if (!entry.name.endsWith(".ts")) continue`), so a `.mjs` copy drifting
 * from this package's published types was pinned by nothing.
 *
 * So this reads capture-core.mjs as TEXT — the same pattern `probe-consent.test.ts`, `probe-chain.test.ts`
 * and `probe-forwarding.test.ts` already use for files a portable tree cannot import — and extracts each
 * typedef's field names by regex rather than importing the module.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT COMPARISONS, because the two typedefs are related to the published types differently:
 *   - `CapturedStructure`/`CapturedInteraction` pass through `server.mjs` UNCHANGED, so they must match
 *     `EMITTED_STRUCTURE`/`EMITTED_INTERACTION` EXACTLY.
 *   - `Capture` is what capture-core.mjs itself RETURNS; `server.mjs` adds `task` and `environment` on
 *     top of it before it reaches a client, so `Capture`'s fields need only be a SUBSET of `EMITTED_RESULT`.
 *     (`meta` is in `EMITTED_RESULT` and not in `Capture` for the same reason — nothing populates it, this
 *     package's own audit found no writer for it, and a subset check does not require it to appear.)

 *  `{{` starts the group, so a lazy `[^]*?` searching from the FIRST `@typedef {{` in the file for the
