 * ## Why a title word is not enough on its own
 *
 * The word check assumes a page's title words appear in its body, which is true of this project's
 * synthetic pages and often false in the wild. gov.uk is titled "Welcome to GOV.UK": `gov` and `uk` fall
 * under the significant-word length, leaving `welcome` as the only word that can vote — and `welcome`
 * appears nowhere in the page, whose h1 reads "The best place to find government services and
 * information". So a capture that read gov.uk perfectly was reported as **"could not read this page"**,
 * and the run refused to report findings about a page it had read.
 *
 * A false refusal is not the safe direction. It looks like caution while quietly making the tool
 * unusable on real sites, and the fix must not be to lower the word length: `with` is four characters
 * and once passed a browser error page as a match for "Project update with an informative illustration",
 * putting two error-page captures into a 1,467-capture dataset. Three-character words would be worse.
 *
 * So the second route is ADDITIVE and made of direct evidence — the page's own accessible names. It can
 * only accept captures this function previously rejected, never reject one it accepted, which is what
 * keeps `verify.corpus.test.ts` honest across 2,122 captures on disk.

 * documented. Extracting them is therefore a step every rule caller must take, and until 2026-08-28 six
 * callers took it six ways: the CLI inline, two audits with byte-identical private `withCensus` helpers,
 * the exporter inline, the eval runner inline, and `score-rules` by spreading `ruleEvidence`.
 *
 * That is not a tidiness complaint, and the evidence is in the repo twice, pointing in OPPOSITE directions:
 *
 *   - The AX census reached the CLI and NOT the two audits, so every census-reading rule was unreachable
 *     exactly where it was being CHECKED while working in the product. Caught only by two gates
 *     disagreeing about one corpus (`1.3.1:no-headings`: `29/29 EXACT` from one, `fired 0x` from the other).
 *   - The DOM census reached the EXPORTER and nothing else — so the first rule to read it would have passed
 *     `rules:gate` on 1,183 conformant records and never once fired for a user. Nothing would have said so:
 *     a rule that is silent in the product looks exactly like a page with nothing to report.
 *
 * The second is the worse half and it was already loaded. A gate that does not exercise what ships is this
 * repo's most-recorded defect; a gate that exercises what does NOT ship is the same defect with the alarm
 * disconnected, because the green result actively vouches for the silence.
 *
 * So there is ONE step, and `rule-oracles.test.ts` DISCOVERS every module that builds a rule input and
 * requires it to call this. Adding an oracle is then one line here rather than six edits and a hope.
 *
 * ABSENT STAYS ABSENT. A capture predating either census yields `undefined`, which every rule must read as
 * "cannot say" and none as "none" — the distinction the whole census exists to preserve. `undefined` also
 * disappears through `JSON.stringify`, so an exported record carries the key only when the count is real.

/**
 * IS THE SWEEP COMPLETE? — capture-integrity-plan C1, computed HOST-SIDE and here is why.
 *
 * The sweep is a SAMPLE that everything downstream reads as a CENSUS. `structure.headings` is what NVDA
 * announced during a quick-nav walk; rules read it as what the page HAS. When those differ, an absence
 * claim is a claim about the walk rather than about the page — which is how `1.3.1:no-headings` and every
 * other absence rule can be wrong without anything noticing.
 *
 * ## Comparing like with like took two corrections
 *
 * The worker's `structureCrossCheck` compared the sweep's length against the ELEMENT count, and
 * `collectPhrase` dedupes — so it compared a deduplicated list against a raw count. Measured 2026-08-29
 * across 106 real captures: 75% of named elements share a name with another, every page has duplicates,
 * and the median sweep/element ratio was 0.24. That produced "97% of pages disagree", about half of it
 * definitional.
 *
 * Counting DISTINCT NAMES in the census fixed most of it — tfl's graphics went from `20 vs 34` to
 * `20 vs 19` — and exposed a finer gap: the sweep dedupes on the ANNOUNCEMENT, so two headings both named
 * "Contact" at different levels are two announcements and one name. This resolves it by extracting the
 * NAME from each announcement, which is why it lives here and not in the worker: `parseAnnouncement` is
 * the single grammar for that, validated on 6,555 cross-channel comparisons, and it is TypeScript the
 * plain-node worker cannot import.
 *
 * ## `elsewhere` is a verdict -- #951
 *
 * The sweep said it reached the end -- `exhausted` both ways -- having found FAR LESS than the page's census.
 * Something held it: a chat widget, a consent overlay, or a cause nobody has read. Its `exhausted` is true
 * about wherever the caret was held, so it says nothing about the page's absences; what it did hear is still
 * on the page. It is a coverage verdict, not a widget detector. See `sweptElsewhere`, the one place that
 * decides it.
 *
 * ## `unknown` is a verdict
 *
 * A capture whose census predates `distinct` cannot answer, and that must never read as `exact`. Absence
 * treated as agreement is the defect this project pays for most often — `census.heading` absent read as
 * zero, `sameState: undefined` read as false, a recovery metric read with `?? 0`.

 * why `unknown` had to be invented as a fourth verdict. Protocol 9 records the fact first-hand, so where

 *
 * ABSENT means a capture older than protocol 9, and absent must not read as `asked: true` — a pre-9

 * A SWEEP THAT SAID IT REACHED THE END, HAVING FOUND FAR LESS THAN THE CENSUS -- #951, the cause of #887.
 *

 * held. Measured on `runs/887-r9A-hubspot-w7.json`: on capture-1 HubSpot's chat widget had opened by itself,
 * and the link and graphic sweeps that followed found the widget's 1 link and 2 graphics, both directions
 * `exhausted`, with no modal open -- so #897's dialog check correctly cannot see it. On capture-2, the same
 * box minutes later, the same sweeps found 44 and 22.
 *
 * WHATEVER HELD IT. The claim is coverage -- found far less than the census -- and not a cause. On the lab's
 * corpus the sweeps it catches are consent overlays and two zeros nobody has read; the chat widget is only in
 * this Mac's `runs/`. So nothing here says "widget", and `container` is a hint, never proof.
 *
 * ## Why not the phrases
 *
 * The rule #951 was filed with -- "every item inside the one container the sweep started in" -- fails its
 * own fixture: the trapped graphic sweep's two items announce two different containers, and the trapped
 * link announces none. No rule reading only phrases can flag that link without flagging a one-link page.
 *
 * ## Where it sits, measured in two populations, on the rule's own denominator
 *
 * Found ÷ `census.distinct.link` for link sweeps `exhausted` in both directions, with at least
 * `LINK_CENSUS_FLOOR` distinct links:
 *
 *                     doubtful                             healthy
 *     local runs/     17 at most 0.066                     77 at least 0.603     this Mac, recounted 2026-09-11;
 *                                                                               a pre-check
 *     lab corpus      4: three zeros-and-ones below 0.1,   80 at least 0.639     corpus-2026-09-11_03-35-45,
 *                     and nrscotland at 0.460                                    orchestrator's gate 1 on #951
 *
 * The local copy has nothing between 0.066 and 0.603. The lab has one sweep at 0.460, a consent overlay that
 * held PART of the sweep -- so what holds a sweep does not always hold all of it, and a threshold at 0.1
 * would have missed it. product-manager's placement, on #951: above the highest doubtful sweep in EITHER
 * population (0.460) and below the lowest healthy in either (0.603). It marks no healthy sweep in either.
 *
 * Two lab sweeps the placement was first argued from are not in that table, and the fixture says why.
 * `nrscotland/statistics-and-data` is 0.479 on the RAW census but 0.639 on `distinct`, so it is healthy by the
 * rule's own measure. `sepa/bathing-waters` has no `distinct` census at all, so the rule cannot judge it.
 *
 * ## The floor
 *
 * Below `LINK_CENSUS_FLOOR` distinct links the rule does not judge. One link found or not found is not
 * evidence that anything held the sweep: `focus-panel-undismissable-help`, a known-good dataset page, counts
 * one distinct link and its sweep finds none, which is below every threshold. The lab's gate-1 population
 * already had the floor. Under it, the census comparison answers exactly as before #951 -- so
 * `keyboard-trap-modal-escape.bad` (0 of 6) reads `truncated`, its absence still withheld.
 *
 * GRAPHICS HAVE NO GAP TO USE -- locally, trapped at most 0.074 and a page's own sweep from 0.131 -- but the
 * collapse is the CAPTURE's, not the channel's: all 17 local trapped-link captures with a graphic census
 * collapse on graphics too, and none collapses on graphics without a trapped link. So a graphic sweep
 * follows its capture's link verdict.
 *
 * ## The direction of error
 *
 * `elsewhere` WITHHOLDS: it never asserts the page has more links than were found. A page the census
 * over-counts is withheld from, never accused -- #894's principle, "withholding needs doubt".

/**
 * Was the CDP target a census mark came from ever confirmed to be the page this capture navigated to? —
 * and if not, WHY, in words rather than the bare token `fallback`.
 *
 * `docs/backlog.md`'s furniture-census row is the reason this exists: `bathingwaters.sepa.org.uk` and
 * `lbhf.gov.uk/council-tax` returned a byte-identical census because `choosePageTarget` took a Cookiebot
 * widget's own CDP target, and nothing downstream could tell — a wrong-document census is not ABSENT
 * evidence, the way a genuinely headless page's `heading: 0` is; it is evidence of a DIFFERENT page wearing
 * this one's name, which every consumer of `census`/`dom` was trusting unconditionally.
 *
 * `targetMatch: "matched"` is the only outcome that PROVES the target: `choosePageTarget` confirmed its
 * path and query against the URL this capture navigated to.
 *
 * **`"fallback"` is suspect UNLESS `candidates <= 1` AND our own submit did not cause it** — refined
 * 2026-09-06, known-gaps §41, TWICE the same day. `candidates <= 1` used to read as safe outright
 * ("nothing else this fallback COULD have picked"), until `probeRouteChange` (2.4.2's link-follow) was
 * measured landing the SAME single tab on a different real document mid-capture — two GOV.UK Design
 * System pages' post-navigation censuses read `fallback, candidates: 1` and were BYTE-IDENTICAL despite
 * the requested pages differing by 11 headings and 136 links (20 of 20 real pages sampled, `known-gaps.md`
 * §40). That made `candidates <= 1` ALONE unsafe. `navigateByStructure` (`capture-probes.mjs`) then closed
 * §40 itself by taking its one `structureCensus` reading BEFORE `probeRouteChange` runs, so a route-change
 * mismatch can no longer reach the mark this function reads — leaving OUR OWN FORM SUBMIT as the only
 * other thing capable of moving the document before that reading.
 *
 * **The first attempt to detect that read `navigatedOnSubmit`'s ABSENCE as proof nothing navigated, and
 * it was wrong, checked against a real capture rather than assumed correct.** `w3.org/.../survey.html`'s
 * submit DID navigate — `interaction.formChanges[0].after` reads `"...Submission Failed Accessible Survey
 * Page, document"`, a different document's title — and `navigatedOnSubmit` is absent anyway, because
 * `capture-probes.mjs:3082` sets it only when `before && after && before !== after`, and `currentPageUrl()`
 * can return falsy on either side without that meaning no navigation happened. So `navigatedOnSubmit`
 * absent conflates three states — no navigation, `currentPageUrl()` failing, or the probe never running —
 * and only its PRESENCE was ever unambiguous. `submitNavigatedTheDocument` (below) is the corrected two-
 * signal check: `navigatedOnSubmit` present is still one sufficient signal, and NVDA's own announcement
 * for a newly loaded document — a title followed by the role "document", exactly what `formChanges[0].after`
 * carried for survey.html — is the second, added because the first one goes silent exactly when a real
 * page's form ACTION points somewhere else. This is a heuristic on announced TEXT, not a wire fact: a
 * genuine error message that happened to end the same way would read as a navigation it was not, and an
 * unusual document announcement this grammar does not anticipate would read as none. This heuristic is
 * now the FALLBACK rather than the only signal for the ambiguous case — see the FIXED note above.
 *
 * So: `candidates <= 1` AND `!submitNavigatedTheDocument(capture)` together mean the mismatch predates
 * anything we did — a genuine site redirect (`tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/`, TfL's own status-page redirect,
 * unaffected throughout: no `formState` means no submit could have run) or an extension/rewrite the
 * requested URL never had. `focus-removed-on-receipt-*`'s own GET-submit and survey.html's own submit both
 * set at least one of the two signals, so both stay suspect exactly as before.
 *
 * **FIXED 2026-09-06 — `navigatedOnSubmit` now records the third state directly, so this function no
 * longer needs the text heuristic for a capture that CONFIRMS either answer.** The interim design a few
 * paragraphs down predicted exactly this fix and kept the heuristic "for a capture whose own signal goes
 * silent exactly when a real page's form ACTION points somewhere else" — that capture is now
 * `checked: false`, and the heuristic still runs for it, and for every capture on disk that predates this
 * fix. Kept as a permanent fallback, not removed: the corpus carries thousands of the old shape, a
 * recapture has not happened yet, and `checked: false` will keep occurring on any future capture where
 * `currentPageUrl()` genuinely fails on one side. Every consumer of `navigatedOnSubmit` in the tree was
 * checked before this note was written, not assumed clean — see the commit message for the list.
 *
 * `"no-expected-url"` is a genuinely different state: no comparison was even ATTEMPTED (a call outside an
 * active capture, e.g. `/diagnostics`), so there is nothing here to have failed. `candidates` remains the
 * deciding factor there — a real second page-type target with nothing to compare it against is still the
 * bathingwaters/lbhf shape, and submit-navigation is irrelevant to it.
 *
 * `candidates` absent while `targetMatch` is present is a capture taken in the gap between the two
 * shipping — this function cannot vouch for it, so it reads the SAME as `> 1`: suspect. `targetMatch`
 * absent entirely means this capture predates `choosePageTarget`'s fix altogether, and is read as before
 * this existed -- not suspect -- because there is nothing here to doubt it WITH; every historical capture
 * was already being trusted, and this field cannot retroactively accuse one it was never computed for.
 *
 * EXPORTED (both this and `censusSuspectReason`) so `check-real-page-findings.ts`'s human-facing report can
 * ask the identical question of the RAW mark -- the one place that must see a suspect census even though
 * `pageCensus`/`domCensus` correctly hide its numbers. One rule, not two: a second copy here is exactly the
 * "fact stated twice" shape this repo keeps paying for.
 *
 * @param record the census mark's own target fields
 * @param submitNavigated the SAME capture's `submitNavigatedTheDocument(capture)` — a plain boolean, not
 *   the raw interaction fields, so this function's OWN logic is the one place the two signals are combined
 *   and every caller passes the identical verdict. A caller with no capture at hand (there is none left;
 *   both readers below have one) must still pass `false` explicitly rather than omit the argument.

 *     readThrough  330 s / 12 lines (maxSteps)      -- against ~20 s / 30 for the same base page
 *     links        swept 0, census 6                -- observed.complete false, stop {prev,next} silent
 *     graphics     swept 0, census 1                -- likewise; the tree even names it, "DSC_0421.jpg"
 *
 * `heardAHeading` was false, so the capture passed, went into the corpus, and surfaced hours later as a
 * `grants-audit` failure — a record labelled for a defect its capture did not carry. A fresh capture of
 * the same page was clean in 22 s, so the page was never at fault.
 *
 * ALL FOUR CONDITIONS ARE REQUIRED, and each rules out a legitimate shape:
 *
 *   census > 0        the tree says the element is there, so "the page has none" is excluded
 *   sweep found 0     not a shortfall, a total absence
 *   complete false    the sweep did NOT run to exhaustion, so this is not the documented residual gap
 *                     between quick-nav and the tree ("a question about this tool, not the page")
 *   stop silent       NVDA answered nothing, rather than "no next link" — the announced terminus
 *
 * That last pair is the whole discipline of `observed`: `exhausted` is the screen reader's own answer and
 * `silent` is an inference we refuse to trust. A sweep that ran out honestly is evidence; one that heard
 * nothing while the tree names the element is a capture that could not ask.
 *
 * This does NOT reject evidence whose absence is the finding — the rule this file exists to protect. An
 * unnamed control, a missing alt, a page with no headings: in every one of those the CENSUS is 0 too, so
 * the first condition already excludes them.

 * verdict can still flip to `contained` once the marks do arrive. `observedAtMs` is the LATER of the two
 * marks' timestamps — "the moment both inputs exist" (#426's own revised acceptance; "within ~60s" was
