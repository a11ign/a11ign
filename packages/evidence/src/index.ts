/**
 * The capture backend interface.
 *
 * A capture backend drives ONE real screen reader through real navigation and
 * returns what it announced. Backends are operating-system-bound (NVDA on
 * Windows, VoiceOver on macOS, Orca on Linux) and run as network services, so
 * the portable core can talk to any of them the same way. The design rationale
 * is in docs/adr/0001-capture-architecture.md.
 *
 * `evidence` has more workspace dependents than any other package (cli, judge, lab, nvda-worker, scorer,
 * worker-fleet all depend on it, transitively), so a change scoped to this file is the MANY-DEPENDENTS
 * case for `ci.yml`'s `testPackages` scoping (#175) -- the widest fan-out `testPackages` can produce from
 * a single-package diff.
