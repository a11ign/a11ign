/**
 * THE PUBLISHED CaptureRequest MUST NAME EVERY FIELD THE WORKER ACCEPTS.
 *
 * architecture-audit.md §5, item 1: until 2026-09-05 `CaptureRequest` declared `url, task, strategy?` while
 * `server.mjs`'s `POST /capture` accepted 20 fields — every probe flag, `formState`, `probeOrder`,
 * `reuseBrowser`, `browser`, `reuseScreenReader`, `captureId` and `async`. A consumer typing against
 * `@a11ign/evidence` could not have known a single one of them existed. This is the sibling of
 * `wire-types-describe-the-wire.test.ts`, same defect, the opposite side of the wire.
 *
 * `strategy` is deliberately EXCLUDED from the comparison below, the same way `meta` was excluded from
 * `Capture`'s subset check on the response side: it is a forward-looking abstraction for a backend that
 * does not exist yet (VoiceOver, Orca), nothing on today's wire reads `opts.strategy`, and the check here
 * runs in one direction only — every field the WIRE accepts must be DECLARED, not the reverse. A type
 * naming more than the one real backend implements is fine; a type naming less than it does is the bug.
 *
 * The fields below are read from `server.mjs` and `capture-pure.mjs` as TEXT, not imported: both are
 * reachable from `capture-core.mjs`, which constructs a `ScreenReader` at module scope and throws on any
 * host without a supported screen reader (`no-win32-imports.test.ts`'s reason for existing at all), so an
 * `evidence` test cannot import them without either poisoning a portable install or inverting the
 * dependency graph (`nvda-worker` already depends on `evidence` for types, never the other way).
