/**
 * WHICH DOCUMENT WAS THIS CAPTURE SERVED? — #687.
 *
 * `environmentKey()` keys a capture on everything about the ENVIRONMENT — browser and version, OS,
 * architecture, NVDA, guidepup, screen-reader settings, `provisionRevision`, `CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
 * — and, for corpus pages, on the page directory. It records nothing about what the server actually
 * SENT. So two captures of one URL, under an identical key, can describe different documents and
 * nothing in the pipeline can notice.
 *
 * Measured on `https://calendly.com/`, eight minutes apart, same worker, same command (#685):
 *
 *     10:42  served accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier  "Sign in - Google Accounts"
 *     10:50  served calendly.com/scheduling                   "Automated scheduling software Calendly …"
 *
 * Both records say `url: "https://calendly.com/"` and both say `landedOnRequested: ok`. The difference
 * is recorded — on the census marks, which carry the CDP target's own URL — and until this module
 * nothing read it. That is this repository's most recorded shape: a diagnostic written and never
 * consumed.
 *
 * ## What is compared, and what is only reported
 *
 * **Compared: the served path and the document title.** Those say WHICH document. A difference in
 * either is a difference in identity.
 *
 * **Reported, never compared: the structural counts** (`shape` below). #687 asked for the census counts
 * in the digest, and they are here — but they must not decide the verdict, because a count differs on
 * every real page that legitimately changed between two captures. A news homepage recaptured an hour
 * later has moved 40 links and is the same document; calendly's sign-in wall has moved 59 links and is
 * not. Deciding identity on counts would fire on the first case, which is most of the population this
 * runs against, and the refusal would be ignored within a day. The counts are here so a reader can see
 * the render they were given; the path and the title are what say it is a different page.
 *
 * ## The digest is a LABEL, not the comparison
 *
 * `digest` exists so a report line can name a render in eight characters. `compareIdentity` compares
 * the component VALUES, never the digests — a hash that collided would otherwise be able to say "same
 * document", and a guard whose whole job is to refuse must not have a path on which it blesses by
 * accident.
 *
 * **An identity that read NOTHING has no digest** (`null`, #2116), for the same reason seen from the
 * label's side: naming it would hand `null`, `{}`, a wrong-level wrapper and a `*-a11ign-result.json`
 * fixture (a RESULT — it carries no `diagnostics`, which is what this reads) one render-shaped label, and
 * an identity assertion written against the wrong object would pass by comparing nothing while printing
 * what looks like a reading. **A NOTE FOR THE NEXT TEST AUTHOR:** assert `read` is non-empty, or
 * `compared` is, before an emptiness assertion on `differing` — `[]` over an empty population is not a
 * finding. `fixtures/calendly-687.json` (`captures[n].capture`) is the fixture that can fail; the
 * `rehearsal*` result fixtures cannot answer identity, and that is what a result is.
 *
 * ## Every component is optional, and an absence is never a difference
 *
 * Measured across the records on disk: a real-page capture carries `structureCensus`, `domCensus` and
 * `titleSource`; a corpus capture (`image-missing-alt-bulk-day-centre-062.good.json`) carries only
 * `structureCensus`, with no `targetUrl`, no `domCensus` and no `titleSource` at all. So a component
 * read in one capture and absent from the other is INCOMPARABLE, never a difference — the absence of a
 * measurement is not the measurement zero (#677) — and when no component can be compared the verdict is
 * `UNCOMPARABLE`, never `SAME_DOCUMENT`.
 *
 * That asymmetry is deliberate and it is what makes this safe to put in front of every existing
 * comparison: **this check can only ever add a refusal.** When identity cannot be established the
 * caller behaves exactly as it did before, and says so.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * `probeStates` (verify.ts) asks whether the page moved BETWEEN THE PROBES OF ONE CAPTURE. This asks
 * whether TWO CAPTURES describe the same document. They share `FINGERPRINT_KEYS` — imported, not
 * re-spelled, because `gate-probe-order.mjs` already recorded what happens when this exact concept gets
 * a second copy: "this copy compares four counts, and `FINGERPRINT_KEYS` has six".
 *
 * And it is not a cache key. See `capture-cache.mjs`'s `environmentKey`, and
 * `document-identity-is-not-a-cache-key.test.ts` for why adding it there would cost a full recapture of
 * 2,122+ captures to guard a population that is empty.
