/**
 * WCAG's five CONFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS, and what one run of this tool can honestly say about each.
 *
 * Every automated accessibility tool reports against success criteria — 1.1.1, 2.4.6, and so on. But
 * WCAG 2.x §5.2 puts five further requirements on any conformance claim, and they are the part that
 * decides whether a claim is valid at all:
 *
 *   1. Conformance Level    — every criterion at the claimed level is satisfied
 *   2. Full pages           — conformance is for a WHOLE page; you may not exclude part of it
 *   3. Complete processes    — every page in a process must conform
 *   4. Accessibility-supported ways of using technologies
 *   5. Non-Interference      — 1.4.2, 2.1.2, 2.2.2 and 2.3.1 apply to ALL content on the page, even
 *                              content not relied upon to meet any other criterion
 *
 * A tool cannot make a page conform. What it can do is never imply conformance it has not established,
 * and that is what this module is for: it turns each requirement into a pair of statements — what this
 * run DID establish, and what it did not. Both are always present. `everyRequirementStatesALimit` in the
 * tests enforces that, because the failure mode is not a wrong sentence, it is a missing one: a report
 * that lists findings and stops invites the reader to conclude the rest of the page is fine.
 *
 * This is the same rule the rest of the codebase already applies to a skipped axe run and to an
 * abstaining scorer — "UNCHECKED, not clean" — raised from individual criteria to the requirements that
 * govern the whole claim.

 * always the page.
 *
 * Measured on `runs/781-r1-hubspot.json/capture-1`: the `landmark` sweep's last stop was literally
 * `"Hub Bot, dialog"` — it walked into HubSpot's chat widget and left the caret inside an open dialog.
 * The three sweeps that ran while it was open each truthfully exhausted that dialog:
 *
 *     formField  found 12, and every one of them is a chat-widget control
 *     graphic    found 2   ("Avatar of Hub Bot", "Message History ... Avatar of Hub Bot")
 *     link       found 1   ("privacy policy, link")   against a census of 79
 *
 * The `list` sweep, after the dialog closed, found the real page's 22 lists, and the `frame` sweep saw
 * the widget as `"... Open live chat, button, opens dialog"` — closed again. **Nothing was wrong with the
 * page, the worker or the build.** The report then rendered "every structural sweep ran until the page
 * ran out of elements" over a capture that had examined a chat dialog.
 *
 * ## THE NUMBER THIS COMPARES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE
 *
 * **A sweep cannot have visited more elements than it made trips.** 8 trips against a census of 79 links
 * is arithmetic, not a threshold somebody chose, and it needs no constant.
 *
 * It does NOT prove the sweep was scoped wrongly. The census counts AX nodes in roles the quick-navigation
 * key may not reach at all — #800's finding, and the reason `formControl` and `f` disagree — so a sweep
 * can legitimately make fewer trips than the census has elements.
 *
 * **Which is why this WITHHOLDS a claim rather than making one. Withholding needs doubt; asserting needs
 * proof.** Requirement 2's full-page sentence is an affirmative assertion that the page ran out, and that
 * asymmetry is the whole reason this direction is safe: being wrong here costs a claim nobody was owed,
 * while being wrong the other way puts a completeness sentence over a page that was never read. The
 * numbers are named so a reader can weigh them rather than take the verdict.
 *
 * Only sweeps where BOTH directions ran out are considered — a half-exhausted sweep is already truncated

/**
 * Why this report is NOT a conformance claim, and what a claim would additionally need.
 *
 * WCAG §5.3 makes claims optional but specifies exactly what one must carry: the date, the URIs covered,
 * the version and level claimed, the accessibility-supported technologies RELIED UPON, and the technologies
 * used but not relied upon. We hold the first three; the last two are the author's determination about
 * their own site, not an observation a tool can make — "relied upon" means the content would not conform
 * with that technology turned off, which only the author knows they intended.
 *
 * Stated out loud because a document listing WCAG criteria, evidence and a date looks exactly like a claim
 * to a reader who has not read §5.3, and a report mistaken for a certificate is the most damaging way this
 * output could be misread.
