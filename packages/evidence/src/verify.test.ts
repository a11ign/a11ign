/**
 * ISSUE #30 — a GET submit reloads the same document with a query string, and the census refused it.
 *
 * `censusSuspectReason` trusts a one-candidate fallback UNLESS the submit navigated. A GET submit rewrites
 * the URL, `submitNavigatedTheDocument` said "navigated", and a census of a page nothing was wrong with was
 * refused. The widening branch that reads this predicate was added the same day, so this is the cost of
 * that guard surfacing rather than an old defect.
 *
 * THE TWO QUESTIONS ARE DIFFERENT AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX. `sameDocument` asks "is this the same page for
 * evidence purposes", where a search RESULTS page genuinely differs from the search FORM —
 * `known-gaps.md`'s objection to widening on query strings, which stands. This predicate asks only whether
 * the submit reached a different DOCUMENT. The last test below pins the objection's own example, so nobody
 * widens `sameDocument` later on the strength of this change.
