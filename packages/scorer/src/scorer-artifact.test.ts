/**
 * The committed weights and the committed trainer must agree on the feature schema.
 *
 * `score-screenreader-model.py` refuses to load weights whose `representation` metadata does not match the
 * trainer's `FEATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION` — a correct guard, because a mismatch means the inputs the heads
 * were fitted on are not the inputs being computed. But it can only refuse at RUNTIME, on a machine
 * with Python, an encoder and a capture to score. Nothing checked the committed artifacts against each
 * other, and they had drifted:
 *
 *     model.safetensors metadata     screenreader-structured-v4
 *     train-screenreader-model.py    screenreader-structured-v1   (at HEAD)
 *
 * The v4 trainer existed only as an uncommitted file in one working tree, so **a fresh clone could not
 * score anything at all** — the default judge backend (`judge-backend: local`, and `JUDGE_BACKEND`'s
 * default) was broken for every consumer, and had been since before the weights were last retrained.
 *
 * `referenced-scripts.test.ts` cannot catch this: the trainer IS tracked. It is tracked at the wrong
 * version, which is the same defect family — "the working tree is not the repo" — wearing a different
 * disguise.
 *
 * Reads the safetensors header directly rather than shelling out to Python: the format is an 8-byte
 * little-endian header length followed by JSON, so this needs no venv and runs in CI, which is the one
 * environment that sees only committed files.
