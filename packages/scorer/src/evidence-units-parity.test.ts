/**
 * ONE MODEL-INPUT FUNCTION, WRITTEN TWICE ACROSS A LANGUAGE BOUNDARY, AND THE COPIES DISAGREED.
 *
 * `evidenceUnits` (this package's `evidence-units.ts`) is what every training record is built through —
 * `export-screenreader-dataset.mjs` and `build-realism-tier.mjs` both call it, and it deliberately omits
 * `landmarks` for a measured reason (see its own comment: the landmark sweep is nondeterministic and swung
 * a conformant page's 3.3.2 score across the threshold). `score.py`'s `evidence_units` is the SAME
 * function, needed because this package ships with zero npm dependencies and its README documents
 * `score.py --capture-json <file>` as a standalone entry a consumer runs with no TypeScript upstream of it
 * — so the two cannot be merged into one implementation without breaking that public contract.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-06 they disagreed on exactly one channel: Python appended `landmark-navigation` and
 * TypeScript did not. `local-judge.ts` sends every LIVE capture to `score.py --stdin`, which builds its
 * record through the Python function — so every live page and every real-page calibration fed the encoder
 * a unit type that appears in NO training record, averaging ~12 extra units and up to 25 on a single real
 * page (measured across the real-page corpus). Found by the architecture audit (`docs/architecture-audit.md`
 * §4.1), not by a test — `model-input.test.ts` checks two JS suspects and structurally cannot see
 * `score.py`, and the two dataset-contract guards this file's own header already knows about
 * (`test_input_contract_version.py`) pin a VERSION NUMBER, never the unit list itself.
 *
 * The remedy is the one direction available: the weights are fitted to the TypeScript units, so `score.py`
 * stopped appending landmarks rather than TypeScript learning to compute them — that would re-introduce
 * the nondeterminism the TS comment exists to keep out. See `score.py`'s own comment on `evidence_units`
 * for the full reasoning, including why `MODEL_INPUT_VERSION` does not move for this (it versions record
 * SHAPE, not this bug).
 *
 * This test is the third repo remedy for "a fact stated twice" applied across a language boundary that
 * cannot be closed by deleting a copy or deriving one from the other: it spawns Python's real
 * `evidence_units` (via the same `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` trick
 * `test_live_capture_carries_the_parse.py` already uses, so it exercises the actual shipped function, never
 * a restated copy) over a shared table of captures and asserts the unit list matches TypeScript's exactly.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT need the Python venv, torch, or the encoder: `score.py`'s inference path moved off
 * torch to ONNX + numpy (`scorer-paths.test.ts` pins that), so importing the module and calling a pure
 * function on it needs nothing beyond a plain `python3` — confirmed empirically before writing this file,
 * because a parity test that skips whenever the venv is absent would have caught nothing on the ONE run
 * that mattered here (a laptop with no venv scoring a real page for the first time).
