/**
 * EVERY BUILDER OF A TRAINING RECORD MUST EMIT `observation`, AND THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM.
 *
 * `observation` is a sibling of `input` carrying which questions the capture actually put, and the
 * featurizer crosses two channels with it. Its failure mode is the worst kind: **absent and `asked: false`
 * are the same row by design**, so a builder that never learned about the field produces records that are
 * structurally valid, featurize cleanly, and quietly say "nobody looked" about every capture it made.
 * Nothing downstream can tell that from the truth.
 *
 * It was missed at two of the four sites within an hour of being written, and neither miss was careless:
 *
 * - `build-realism-tier.mjs` — every REAL-PAGE record, the tier that grounds the model in real sites.
 *   The comment directly above its `modelInput(capture)` call already warned about this exact drift:
 *   *"These two constructed the model's input separately until 2026-08-24, and the copies drifted the
 *   moment the contract gained a field."* The contract gained a field, and the copy drifted again.
 * - `score.py` — the PRODUCT path. It SELECTS keys, so a live capture would have reached the model with
 *   both crossed columns at zero while every corpus record carried signal: the head fed a row it never
 *   saw in training. Its own comment records the identical miss for `parsed`, which broke the abstention
 *   sweep, and calls it "the model-input contract existing in a fifth place".
 *
 * So this DISCOVERS the builders rather than trusting a list — the same remedy `cli-flags.test.ts` and
 * `worker-code-check.test.ts` apply, and for the same reason: a hand-maintained list of call sites is one
 * more copy of the fact it is checking.
