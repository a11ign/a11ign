/**
 * The declaration must be capable of REFUSING, or it is a diff with a nicer name.
 *
 * This is the gate `#84` names: a candidate whose head set shrinks must say what it retired, why, and
 * where the reasoning lives — never just that it shrank. `3.3.2:unnamed-form-field` almost shipped absent
 * with nothing accounting for it; two sessions spent an evening resolving the ambiguity by ASSUMPTION,
 * each landing on the opposite wrong answer. See `check-retired-heads.ts`'s own header for the full story.
