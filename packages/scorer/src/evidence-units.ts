/**
 * THE MODEL'S INPUT CONTRACT: which capture fields become evidence, and under which channel name.
 *
 * It lives in this package, beside the weights, because **if it changes the weights break.** The featurizer
 * embeds `f"{channel}: {text}"` for every unit (`python/screenreader_features.py`), so a channel name is
 * tokens in every feature vector, versioned by `FEATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION`. ADR 0004 puts the model in its own
 * package for exactly this reason — "the weights are the API; a retrain is a breaking change to scores" —
 * and a contract that decides feature values has to version with them or the two can drift apart while both
 * look current.
 *
 * ## It was in `case-matrix.mjs`, and that is why it got duplicated
 *
 * The channel table sat inside a 1,700-line generator of SYNTHETIC test cases. So when a consumer needed
 * evidence units for REAL pages, it wrote its own table rather than importing from a file about synthetic
 * cases — and the two disagreed: `form-navigation` against `form-field-navigation`, `transcript` and
 * `control-navigation` and `post-submit-navigation` missing entirely, and four channels
 * (`landmark`/`link`/`list`/`graphic-navigation`) that existed only on the real-page side.
 *
 * The consequence was not a cosmetic mismatch. Four channel tokens appeared only on real records and three
 * only on synthetic ones, so a linear head could separate the two populations on channel names alone — the
 * strongest possible shortcut feature, and a systematic one. `build-realism-tier.mjs` even carried a comment
 * stating the hazard ("the channel names must match the generator's exactly ... and nothing would report
 * that") directly above the table that had it.
 *
 * The misplacement caused the duplication, so the fix is the move, not a second round of care.
 *
 * ## The parameter type is deliberately narrow
 *
 * It declares the fields the featurizer reads rather than importing `CaptureResult`, for two reasons. This
 * package has ZERO dependencies and that is worth keeping. And a capture also carries `url`, `html` and
 * `diagnostics`, which `assertModelBoundary` forbids the model from ever seeing — so naming only the
 * readable fields makes the model-input boundary explicit in the type system instead of in a lint rule.
 * TypeScript is structural, so a real `CaptureResult` satisfies this without a cast.

  // `["Cycling guide"]` (the h1, which is what NVDA announces on entering `main`) in the next. Fed to
  // the encoder, that swung a CONFORMANT page's 3.3.2 score from 0.004 to 0.39 across a 0.35 threshold,
  // so the same page was judged clean once and failing once -- on two acceptance cases.
  //
  // Anchoring does not rescue it: measured over three runs per page it left one page still varying
  // (1 of 3) and made another LOSE a landmark it had previously found. The field cannot currently be
  // both deterministic and complete, so it must not be an input to a scorer.
  //
  // This is the same call the exporter already makes in excluding `1.3.1:missing-landmark`, for the same
  // stated reason -- "not a reliably inferable screen-reader announcement". The field stays in the
  // capture and stays available to the dataset signals, which read `capture.structure.landmarks`
  // directly (`structureIsEmpty`) and are unaffected; and `structureCrossCheck` now reports, per
  // capture, whether the sweep was complete.
  //
  // `links`, `lists` and `graphics` are absent for a DIFFERENT and equally deliberate reason: they are the
  // channels the sweeps truncate first on a large page. Of 26 real-page captures, 9 reported `lists: 0`
  // and every one of those had a list sweep that stopped on `deadline` -- so the field would carry "this
  // page has no lists" as evidence when the truth is "we ran out of budget before asking". A real-page
  // consumer added all four of these channels; that is what this comment exists to stop happening again.

  //
  // Two reasons, and the first is the one that settles it. Every criterion the tab ring decides —
  // `2.1.1`, `2.1.2`, `2.4.3`, and `2.4.1`/`2.4.2` beside them — is `decidedBy: "rules"` in
  // `rule-ownership.json`. The rules read `interaction.focusOrder` directly and compare two sequences
  // arithmetically; the model does not decide those subtypes, so giving it the ring would add an input to
  // heads whose output the product does not use. Their free vetoes are a component fact for the same
  // reason, and ADR 0015 already records the rule: a defect in a component is not a defect in the product
  // until you check what the product does with it.
  //
  // And second, it would reproduce the `lists`/`links` defect exactly. `probeFocus` is opt-in — 43 cases
  // of 1,462 — so the channel is EMPTY on 97% of records, and empty would reach the encoder as "this page
  // has no tab stops" when the truth is "nobody asked". That is the same sentence as the comment above,
  // measured on a different field.
  //
  // So this is a decision, not an omission, and it changes if the ownership does.
