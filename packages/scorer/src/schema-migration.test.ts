/**
 * The declaration must be capable of REFUSING, or it is a skip with a nicer name.

 * This exists because the thing it replaces — `A11Y_SKIP_VERIFY=1` — was routinely used and disabled every
 * other check in the pre-push hook as a side effect. Swapping one silent bypass for another would be no gain,
 * so the two failure modes that matter are pinned here: an OPEN migration must block release, and a verdict
 * function that cannot say no must not pass for one.
