"""The `grants` map the Python audit reads must match the JavaScript that declares it.

`audit_grants.py`'s docstring has named this file since it was written:

    `ACCOMPANYING_DEFECTS` is JavaScript and the features are Python, so neither can import the other. The
    map is emitted to `runs/accompanying-grants.json` by `npm run corpus:grants-map` and read here, with
    `test_grants_map_is_current.py` asserting the file matches the source. Deleting a copy is unavailable;
    CLAUDE.md's remedy for a forced duplication is to pin the copies equal with a test.

**The test did not exist.** A forced duplication with its pin described and never built — which is the
same class as every other defect found on 2026-08-27: a safeguard that is documented, believed in, and
absent. Found by asking what proves each gate, rather than by anything failing.

What it pins, and why each half matters:

- **Every declared feature is one the pipeline actually computes.** A declaration naming a feature that no
  longer exists makes the audit report `STALE` for 52 records with nothing wrong with them, beside a real
  `FAIL` for records genuinely missing evidence. Those need opposite fixes and one of them is not in the
  corpus at all — the audit prints them differently precisely because that distinction cost a diagnosis.
- **Every accompanying defect declares one.** A defect with no `grants` is invisible to the audit, so a
  page labelled for it is never checked for the evidence the label claims.

Deliberately NOT asserting against `runs/accompanying-grants.json`: that file is generated, gitignored,
and its absence is what `corpus:grants-audit` already refuses on. Pinning the SOURCES to each other is the
claim that matters; the emitted file is a transport.
