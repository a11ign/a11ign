"""The acceptance report states its own resolution, so nobody works it out by hand again.

#37's Acceptance reads "the report states the smallest false-positive rate the set can express, and it is
finer than 1%". On 2026-09-22 the set held 436 clean records with 0 false positives, and the bound, 0.873%,
existed only in a comment where it had been computed by hand (`z²/(n+z²) = 3.8416/439.84`). No field in
the report held it (#1922).
