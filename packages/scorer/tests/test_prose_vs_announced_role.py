"""A heuristic about announcement TEXT must account for the roles NVDA announces.

Three separate faults today shared this shape:

  1. `link_name` anchored the role at the start of the phrase, so it read 3.4% of link announcements —
     NVDA almost always prefixes with the context the cursor entered or left.
  2. `graphic_name` had the identical pattern.
  3. `plain_heading_candidate` excluded HEADING announcements and no others, so "button, Show red items"
     — short, unpunctuated, followed by a sentence — matched its "spoken section title" pattern exactly.

The third cost 16 false positives on conformant pages out of 160 held-out records, every one a page whose
button matched. Tightened, the feature is TP 6 / FP 0 / FN 0 on the same set.

These are not three bugs so much as one missing idea: **a screen-reader transcript is not prose.** Every
line either announces a role or is content, and a rule that reasons about "short line of text" has to say
which it means. This file asserts that property directly, on the real role vocabulary.

    # v19: the observation FEATURE CROSS. `float(bool(channel))` cannot separate "the page has none" from
    # "nothing looked", and 61.7% / 56.1% of those zeros (`formChanges` / `postSubmitFields`) are the
    # second -- so a head can take a free negative weight on a capture CONDITION. Masking was refuted
    # (§15) and giving the model
    # `observed` outright was declined (§14); this crosses the existing fact with whether it was measured,
    # so "was this asked" is never separable and "not asked" is the all-zeros row. Four new columns, so it
    # is a WIDTH change as well as a meaning one.
    #
    # v18: the announcement grammar can see a CHECK BOX and a MENU BUTTON. `CONTROL_ROLES` carried the
    # spelling "checkbox", which NVDA never produces, and was missing "check box", which it does -- so
    # `parseAnnouncement` returned NO objects at all for either control, the NAME included, and every
    # feature reading `objects` was blind to them. Found by pointing `--emit-form-config` at a W3C tutorial
    # page, where a correctly-labelled "Subscribe to newsletter, check box" came back as an UNNAMED control:
    # a false 4.1.2 against conformant markup.
    #
    # Measured before bumping, and the number argues both ways so both are recorded: 0 of 1,868 exported
    # records change, because the affected announcements live only in `runs/real-page-corpus` and no
    # synthetic case produces a checkbox. The bump is still right, for the reason the real-page tier exists:
    # the shipped model is scored on somebody's live page, and a page with a checkbox now yields a feature
    # vector the weights were never fitted under. A corpus that cannot exercise a change is not evidence
    # that the change is inert.
    #
    # v17: `validation_error_missing` requires the silent activation to be a SUBMIT. `kind` has travelled
    # on every `formChanges` entry since CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION 8 and NOTHING read it -- not this
    # featurizer and not `rules.ts`, which contains the string zero times -- so a disclosure that announced
    # nothing satisfied a feature about forms rejected without an error. capture-core added the field after
    # apache.org's search toggle was reported exactly that way, and 3.3.1 is one of only three subtypes the
    # model decides alone, so this one reached a report. Same evidence, different values: a meaning change.
    #
    # v16: `landmark_present` and `landmark_named` are no longer model inputs -- known-gaps §17. Measured
    # on 80 protocol-7 captures: 16 have `landmark_present = 0` and ALL SIXTEEN have a truncated landmark
    # sweep, so the negative class was entirely a capture artefact with a documented systematic cause.
    # The head width changed, so weights fitted before it were fitted to a different input space.
    #
    # v15: `vague_link_present` is no longer a model input at all. It answers 2.4.9 (text alone, AAA, not
    # reported here) and the 2.4.4 head used it because it was the cheapest separator -- firing on 22 of the
    # 44 conformant pages that carry "Details" inside a peer index.
    # v20 (#2188): `generic_heading_present` asks whether a one-word section heading RELATES to its section,
    # which is WCAG 2.4.6's question, instead of whether the heading is on a word list. The values change on
    # existing records, so it is a meaning change; see `unrelated_section_heading_present`.
