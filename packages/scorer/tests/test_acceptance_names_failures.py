"""An acceptance failure must name the cases that failed, not just count them.

Measured 2026-08-23 against the shipped model on a fresh held-out set: `1.3.1: acceptance false negatives`
and `2.4.6: acceptance false positives`, two of each. From the report it was impossible to tell whether
that was one subtype systematically missed or two unlucky pages — and those need completely different
responses. Answering it meant re-running the evaluator by hand with print statements.

The repo already states the rule, in `capture-real-pages`: "Named, not counted. '3 failed' tells you
nothing about whether the corpus is usable."
