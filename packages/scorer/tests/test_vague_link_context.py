"""2.4.4 is Link Purpose IN CONTEXT, and the feature must ask that question.

`vague_link_present` asks whether the link TEXT ALONE is vague. That is 2.4.9 — a AAA criterion this project
does not report — and it cannot separate the two senses of the same word. Measured consequence: the scorer
accused 11 GOV.UK Design System pages of 2.4.4 on `"link, Details"`, where Details is a component they
document; and after the corpus was taught that the word can be conformant, it stopped flagging a genuinely
vague `<a href="#note">Details</a>` on a held-out acceptance page.

Both are the same missing distinction, in opposite directions. The announcements below are verbatim from
real captures.
