""""Does this subtype fire?" must have ONE definition, and nothing may answer it privately.

It had two. `score.py` compared `value >= threshold` in its scoring loop, and
`evaluate-screenreader-acceptance.py` did the same thing again over numpy arrays. Adding the applicability
gate to the first left the second untouched — so the gate was live in the product and absent from the
held-out measurement that judges the product, and the acceptance run went on scoring pages the product
rules inapplicable.

The failure mode is worse than a plain bug. The gate was correct, committed, tested, and produced NO
CHANGE in the number, which reads as "the fix did not work" and argues for abandoning a correct change.
That is `refreshBrowseBuffer` exactly — a remedy reachable from one path, confirmed by results it had no
part in producing — committed here while fixing something else.

So: both files must route through `applicability.decide`, and neither may compare a subtype score to a
threshold itself. Asserted on source text because the alternative is loading a model and scoring a corpus,
and a guard that costs that much is one that does not run.
