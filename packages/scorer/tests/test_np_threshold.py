"""Neyman-Pearson type-I error control: the cut promises something about pages nobody has seen.

Replaces a grid search for "the lowest cut with zero false positives on the development set". That
target is free and unfalsifiable — the threshold was chosen to make it true, so all thirteen heads
reported precision 1.000 by construction and the number measured nothing. Worse, it made the cut an
extreme order statistic on a 0.05 grid, so on 2026-08-24 one conformant record crossing 0.90 moved
`3.3.1` from 15 missed findings to 24 and read exactly like the head getting worse.

Tong, Feng & Li (Science Advances, 2018), Proposition 1: for `1(score > s_(r))` over `n` held-out
negatives, P[population type I error > alpha] <= v(r) = SUM_{j=r..n} C(n,j)(1-alpha)^j alpha^(n-j),
and control needs n >= log(delta)/log(1-alpha).

The numbers below are checked against that arithmetic directly, not against our implementation's own
output — a test that re-derives its expectations from the code it is testing is this repo's oldest
recurring defect.
