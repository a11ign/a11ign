"""The unclosable-veto map the Python audit reads must match the JavaScript that declares it.

`audit-scorer-shortcuts.py` reports which vetoes no corpus work can close, and the two tables that say so
live in `audit-corpus-starvation.mjs` — JavaScript, because that is where the corpus-side audit already
used one of them. Neither language can import the other, so the map is emitted to
`runs/unclosable-vetoes.json` by `npm run corpus:unclosable-map` and read there.

CLAUDE.md's remedies for a fact stated twice are, in order: delete a copy, derive one from the other, pin
them equal with a test. The first two are unavailable across the language boundary; this is the third, and
it is modelled on `test_grants_map_is_current.py` — which itself existed only as a promise in a docstring
for months before anyone built it.

What it pins:

- **Every feature named is one the pipeline actually computes.** A table naming a feature that no longer
  exists would forgive a veto that cannot occur, and quietly shrink the work list by pretending an item
  was impossible rather than done.
- **Every subtype named is one the trained model actually has a head for.** The same failure keyed the
  other way: forgiving a subtype nobody trains is forgiving nothing, and reads as coverage.
- **The two categories stay SEPARATE.** `by-definition` is about meaning and is permanent;
  `perturbs-measurement` is about this probe and could change if the probe did. A reader acts on them
  differently, so a merged map would be a worse fact than two.
