"""Is a subtype's claim even ABOUT this page?

A head scores every record it is given. `1.3.1:unassociated-table` is a claim about a table, and on a page
with no table the honest answer is not a low score — it is INAPPLICABLE, which is already a first-class
outcome this project reports (ACT/EARL `inapplicable`, alongside `passed`, `failed` and `cantTell`).

## Why a threshold cannot do this job

Measured 2026-08-25 on `acceptance-link-permits/bad`, the last failure standing after recalibration. The
whole page is three announcements::

    heading, level 1, Permits
    Permits are required for overnight stays.
    link, Go

Its only defect is 2.4.4, which the model gets right. `1.3.1` fired as well, with EVERY 1.3.1-relevant
feature at zero — no table, `plain_heading_candidate_present = 0`. Thirty structured features against 384
encoder dimensions, and the head decided from the embedding.

This repo already wrote the rule down, one criterion over, on 2026-08-24:

    A ZERO CANNOT VETO, so "A and not B" must be computed, never handed over as two features. A linear
    head only ADDS.

`table_present = 0` cannot suppress anything, however the weights are fitted. Raising the threshold
instead would cost real findings on pages that DO have tables, which is exactly why 1.3.1's cuts barely
moved when every other head's did.

## The rule for choosing a precondition, which is the part that is easy to get wrong

**The precondition is the SUBJECT of the claim, never the defect.** Most subtypes here are findings of
ABSENCE — a state change that announced nothing, a validation error never spoken, an image with no
alternative — and requiring the defect's own feature would delete precisely the evidence the subtype
exists to catch. That is this repo's most expensive rule:

    A check must never reject evidence whose absence is the finding.

So `4.1.2:state-change-silent` requires that a state change HAPPENED, not that anything was announced.
`3.3.1:validation-error-silent` requires that a form was submitted, not that an error was spoken.

## It is verified, not asserted

`test_applicability.py` runs this over every record on disk and fails if ANY record labelled positive for a
subtype is made inapplicable. A precondition that silences a true positive is strictly worse than the false
positive it was meant to remove, and nothing about it would be visible in a score.
