"""
The feature contract: everything that turns a screen-reader capture into the numbers the trained heads
score, plus the head arithmetic itself.

**This module is versioned WITH the weights, and that is why it is here rather than in the trainer.**
`FEATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION` is stamped into `model.safetensors` metadata, so a change to any function in this
file invalidates every weight file that does not carry the new version — the scorer refuses the mismatch
rather than silently scoring against features it was not trained on.

It was extracted from the trainer (now `packages/lab/scripts/train-screenreader-model.py`), which the
scoring program used to load
dynamically by file path. That made the trainer a RUNTIME DEPENDENCY of scoring, so shipping a scorer meant
shipping a trainer, which ADR 0004 rejects: distributing a trainer implies a consumer can reproduce
training, and they cannot — the corpus is not distributed.

Both programs now import this module. Nothing here trains: no splits, no epochs, no thresholds. Those stay
in the trainer, which is deliberately NOT published.

    # `3.3.2:unnamed-form-field` head: the 384 encoder dimensions carry |w| summing to 248.0
    # against 5.98 across all 29 document features, so the explicit relation is a minority
    # vote by two orders of magnitude. `form_field_named` landed at -0.232 (effective -0.463

# v8, 2026-08-23: `link_name` and `graphic_name` stopped anchoring the role at the start of the phrase.
# NVDA prefixes an announcement with the context the cursor entered or left, so `^link,` matched 230 of
# 11,275 link announcements in the corpus — the feature was blind to 98% of them, and `vague_link_present`
# read 0.0 on every page whose vague link was an in-page anchor.
#
# This is a MEANING change, not a refactor: the same evidence now produces different feature values, so
# every weight file trained under v7 was fitted to a different function of the same captures. Bumping is
# what stops a v7 model being scored with v8 features and the difference being read as model behaviour.
# Measured before bumping: 73 corpus records change, all of them labelled `violation`, none clean.
# v17, 2026-08-30: `validation_error_missing` requires the silent activation to be a SUBMIT.
# `kind` has travelled on every `formChanges` entry since protocol 8 and NOTHING read it -- not this file
# and not `rules.ts` -- so a disclosure that announced nothing satisfied a feature about forms rejected
# without an error. capture-core added the field after apache.org's search toggle was reported exactly
# that way. A MEANING change: the same evidence now produces different feature values, and 3.3.1 is one of
# only three subtypes the model decides alone, so this one reaches a report.
# v18, 2026-09-02: the announcement grammar can see a CHECK BOX and a MENU BUTTON. `CONTROL_ROLES` carried
# `"checkbox"` and NVDA says `"check box"`, so `parseAnnouncement` returned NO objects at all for either --
# name included -- and every feature reading `objects` was blind to them.
#
# MEASURED BEFORE BUMPING, and the number argues both ways, so both are stated. **0 of 1,868 records in the
# current export change**: the affected announcements live only in `runs/real-page-corpus`, and no synthetic
# case produces a checkbox. So this bump invalidates weights that would have scored this corpus identically.
#
# It is still right, because the version guards a risk this corpus cannot express. The shipped model is
# scored on somebody's live page, and a page with a checkbox now yields a different feature vector from the
# one the weights were fitted under -- which is exactly "a v17 model scored with v18 features, and the
# difference read as model behaviour". A corpus that cannot exercise a change is not evidence the change is
# inert; it is the reason the real-page tier exists.
# v19, 2026-09-03: the observation FEATURE CROSS. Ten structured features are `float(bool(channel))` and
# `any([])` is `False`, so a `0` means both "the page has none" and "nothing looked". Measured on the
# authoritative corpus: 61.7% of empty `formChanges` and 56.1% of empty `postSubmitFields` are the
# second (`emptyNotAsked`). A head can therefore take a free negative weight on a capture CONDITION,
# which is ADR 0015's entire subject.
#
# `formControl` has NO never-asked figure, and not because it has not been measured recently -- the
# quantity does not exist for that channel. `emptyNotAsked` is computed only for `formChanges` and
# `postSubmitFields` (`observation-ambiguity.mjs`'s `CHANNEL_TO_OBSERVED`); `formControl` has never been
# among them, in any commit of that file. **65.3% was previously quoted here as a third never-asked
# rate, for the `formControl` sweep -- that was false.** The closest real figure, `cannotSay/empty` at
# 64.5% for `formControl`, answers a DIFFERENT question: "no census to compare against", a statement
# about the CORPUS'S AGE, not about any page (`observation-ambiguity.mjs`'s own `cannotSay` comment).
# The provenance of 65.3% is lost -- likely corpus age mislabelled as never-asked, but that is an
# inference nobody can prove, and a record that guesses at its own history is worse than one that
# admits the gap. See #341.
#
# Two routes were closed before this one. Masking was REFUTED (not-working §15, it cost a real finding),
# and giving the model `observed` as its own column was DECIDED AGAINST (§14, for the shortcut risk). This
# is neither: the existing fact is CROSSED with whether it was measured, so "was this asked" is never a
# separable signal. `not asked` is the all-zeros row. CLAUDE.md's 2.4.4 post-mortem states the constraint
# — "'A and not B' must be computed, never handed over as two features" — and *Low-Code AI* names the
# construction a feature cross.
#
# A MEANING change and a WIDTH change: four new columns, and every weight file fitted before them was
# fitted to a different input space. Starts with the two pairs whose starvation is measured; the rest
# follow if the gates hold. Those gates are in known-gaps §35, and a REFUTED outcome reverts this.
#
# v20 (#2188): `generic_heading_present` changes MEANING, from "a heading is on a hand-written word list" to
# "a one-word section heading names nothing its section says" (`unrelated_section_heading_present`). Values
# change on records that already exist -- on the export at the time, 4 conformant "Afterwards" pages turn on
# and, on the acceptance set, `Info` and `General` turn on while `Help` above help content turns OFF -- so
# a v19 head was fitted to a different input and this is not a bump the way #1918's was not.

    (Link Only), AAA, which this project does not report -- and the 2.4.4 head used it anyway, because it
    was the cheapest separator available.

    Measured 2026-08-24, and it is why a contextual feature alone could not fix it. On the 44 conformant
    `component-index` pages, which carry "Details" inside a peer index:

        vague_link_present         = 1.0     pushes the score UP
        vague_link_without_context = 0.0     correct -- the link HAS context

    and the head fired on 22 of them. A ZERO-VALUED FEATURE CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO A LINEAR MODEL: 0 x
    weight is 0, so this feature can push up when it is 1 and can never pull down when it is 0. "Vague AND
    unsupported by context" is a conjunction, and a linear head cannot represent one -- it can only add.
    Removing the wrong-criterion half is what leaves the conjunction already computed here.

    `VAGUE_LINKS` and this function stay exported: when AAA ships, 2.4.9 is exactly the question they ask.

    Reads the transcript as a STREAM, not as independent lines, because that is what it is. NVDA announces a
    container ONCE on entering it and says nothing about it again until "out of list":

        "list, with 35 items, same page, link, Accordion"   <- the prefix appears here
        "link, Cookie banner"                               <- and not here

    contextless. Measured: that accused GOV.UK's table and tabs pages of 2.4.4 on `"link, Details"` sitting
    mid-list, which is exactly the false accusation the feature was added to remove. Corpus lists are short
    enough that the prefix lands on the same line as the only link, so the error is invisible there.

# What a heading is judged AGAINST, and why it is not a list of bad words (#2188, `product-manager`'s ruling).
#
# WCAG 2.4.6 is one sentence with no exception clause -- "Headings and labels describe topic or purpose" --
# and its Understanding page says "a word, or even a single character, may suffice if it provides an
# appropriate cue". ACT rule b49b2e tests each heading against "the first perceivable content after" it:
# `<h1>Opening hours</h1>` passes and `<h1>Weather</h1>` fails above THE SAME content, and its Passed
# Example 4 is the single character `A` above a list of words beginning with A. So the criterion asks whether
# the heading RELATES to what it introduces, which a word list cannot answer in either direction:
#
#   "Help" above help content      on the list -> fired    conformant (the 4 acceptance false positives)
#   "Info" / "General" / "Weather" not on the list -> silent  vague  (the 0.086 and 0.048 false negatives)
#
# The feature was measuring a different question from the criterion, so no threshold could rank the two
# right. This asks the criterion's own: is the heading a single word that the content it introduces never
# uses? A word list survives only as a VETO on that relation (below), never as the decider.
#
# Deliberately narrow, and each restriction is measured rather than assumed:
#   - LEVEL 2 AND DEEPER. An h1 names the page and what follows it is chrome -- a skip link, a navigation
#     list -- so a one-word h1 ("Archive") always looked unrelated to it: 3 conformant training pages.
#   - ONE WORD. A phrase ("Documents needed to renew") carries a topic of its own without needing the
#     content to repeat it; requiring the overlap of a phrase would accuse every descriptive heading whose
#     section is worded differently. This is the ACT `Weather` shape, and it is the shape the corpus's
#     vague headings take.
#   - CONTENT MUST EXIST. 2.4.6 "does not require headings or labels", and a heading with nothing under it
#     has nothing to be unrelated to. Absence of content never fires this.
#
# KNOWN COST, measured on the export at the time: 4 conformant records of one family (`headings-none-guide`)
# carry the one-word h2 "Afterwards" over a paragraph that never says it. Whether that heading is
# descriptive is exactly the judgement 2.4.6 leaves to a person, which is why every finding this feeds is

    # as a form submitted with invalid input and no error announced. Nothing was submitted and nothing was
    # invalid."

    # shape, and the reason CLAUDE.md says to grep every layer that decides on a control when a comment

    # Absent `kind` is treated as a submit, deliberately: captures older than protocol 8 carry no `kind`,

# Which subtypes are scored per ANNOUNCEMENT rather than per capture, and why it is per subtype.
#
# Measured both ways on the same corpus. Instance-max scoring took 4.1.2's heads to precision 0.98 /
# 0.89 / 0.97 -- because "a control announced with a role and no name" is entirely contained in ONE
# announcement ("edit", with nothing after it) and needs no other line to judge.
#
# The same change took 2.4.6 from precision 0.51 to 0.30. Whether "Welcome" is a vague heading depends
# on what the page is ABOUT; scoring that announcement in isolation strips away the context that makes
# vagueness judgeable. For contextual criteria the document view is the correct representation, and
# mean-pooling was never their problem.
#
# So pooling is a property of the SIGNAL, not of the pipeline. Local findings pool by max over
# instances; contextual findings keep the whole capture. Default is document-mean: only subtypes with
# evidence that instance scoring helps are listed here.
# `4.1.2:missing-role` stays instance-max, and the alternative was MEASURED rather than reasoned about.
#
# The argument for moving it to document-mean was good and half of it was right. Instance-max cannot
# express an ABSENCE: there is no announcement carrying the evidence, because the evidence IS that no
# such announcement exists, and all 74 of this subtype's records have `formFields: []` and
# `controls: []`. Document-mean can see the whole capture, and recall duly went 0.809 -> 1.000.
#
# But precision went 1.000 -> 0.782, taking 4.1.2's grouped calibration from FP 2 / FN 13 to FP 21 /
# FN 0. That is the predicted cost: 437 of the corpus's 1,003 CONFORMANT records also announce no
# controls, because a page about images or tables has none either. The document view can represent
# "nothing was announced" and cannot tell it apart from "there was nothing to announce".
#
# So neither view is right, and the choice is between error TYPES. For this tool a false accusation on
# a conformant page is the worst error it can make, which is why the judge suppresses the model where a
# rule already decides. 14 misses at precision 1.000 beats 21 false alarms.
#
# What this subtype actually needs is a FEATURE that separates "a page that should have a control here"
# from "a page with no controls at all" -- the bad variant is a styled div announced as plain text where
# a button belongs. That is a different piece of work from choosing a pooling view, and this comment
# exists so nobody re-runs the pooling experiment expecting a different answer.
#
# ## 3.3.2:unnamed-form-field, added 2026-08-23 — the OPPOSITE direction, deliberately
#
# The paragraphs above warn against re-running the pooling experiment expecting a different answer. That
# experiment moved 4.1.2 from instance-max TO document-mean and measured the cost: precision 1.000 -> 0.782,
# FP 2 -> FP 21. This is the reverse move on a different subtype, and it is that measurement being USED
# rather than ignored: the recorded evidence is that instance-max buys precision and costs recall, and
# 3.3.2 has a precision problem — 8 false accusations on conformant pages, against 0 misses.
#
# Why the average is the wrong question here. A CONFORMING field page announces its field twice: bare when
# focus lands ("edit, Example value") and again with its label ("Company name, edit, Example value"). A mean
# over both lands between them, so which side of the cut a clean page falls on is decided by 384 encoder
# dimensions (|w| sum 248.0) rather than by the 29 document features (|w| sum 5.98) that say plainly
# `form_field_named=1`. "Is there an unnamed field on this page?" is an existence question and a mean
# answers a different one.
#
# Note what was tried first and did NOT work, so nobody repeats it: raising `form_field_named`'s multiplier
# from 2.0 to 6.0. The head simply learned a weight a third the size (-0.2316 -> -0.0717) and the effective
# contribution was unchanged (-0.4632 -> -0.4303). Scaling an input cannot strengthen a relation in a linear
# head, because gradient descent compensates. That applies to every entry in
# ENGINEERED_FEATURE_MULTIPLIERS, which is worth knowing before reaching for one again.
#
# ## 1.3.1:fake-heading, added 2026-08-23 — a rare signal averaged away by page size
#
# Measured: 88 development positives at recall 0.55 (threshold 0.95, FP 0), against 10 of 10 on the
# held-out set. The gap is not difficulty in the failure, it is difficulty in the PAGE: 63 of the 88
# positives are accompaniment-derived and sit on pages averaging 52.3 announcements, while the dedicated
# fake-heading pages average 41.6. A document mean gives one fake heading among 52 lines a 1/52 share; the
# same failure on a focused page dominates its own mean. The head is being diluted by page length.
#
# The reverse move on 4.1.2 recorded what to expect: instance-max -> document-mean cost precision
# 1.000 -> 0.782, FP 2 -> FP 21. So instance-max BUYS precision, and this head has precision to spare
# (FP 0) and recall to gain (0.55). Note this is the opposite situation to `3.3.2:unnamed-form-field`
# earlier the same day, where switching pooling changed nothing: there both views fired on a bare edit that
# was genuinely present, so there was nothing to dilute. Rare-signal dilution is the case max is for.
