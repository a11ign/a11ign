    """The LIVE path's copy of `evidenceUnits` (`packages/scorer/src/evidence-units.ts`).

    A second implementation was always going to exist here: this package ships with ZERO npm/Node
    dependencies (see that file's own header) and its README documents `score.py --capture-json <file>` as
    a standalone entry point a consumer runs directly on a raw capture, with no TypeScript upstream of it —
    so "stop having its own implementation" is not reachable without breaking that public contract. What IS
    reachable, and was missing until 2026-09-06, is making the two implementations compute the SAME units.

    `landmark-navigation` was appended here and NOT in the TypeScript `evidenceUnits`, whose own comment
    records why at length: the landmark sweep is nondeterministic (`[]` on one capture of an unchanged page,
    `["Cycling guide"]` on the next), and it measurably swung a conformant page's 3.3.2 score across the
    0.35 threshold. So the TRAINING data — built exclusively through the TypeScript function, via
    `export-screenreader-dataset.mjs` and `build-realism-tier.mjs` — never carried a `landmark-navigation`
    unit. Every LIVE capture and every real-page calibration, scored through `raw_capture_record` below,
    carried 12 of them on average and up to 25 on a single real page (measured across the 23 real-page-corpus
    captures that have any landmarks at all) — a unit type the encoder's weights were never fitted against.

    Deleting the append line, rather than teaching the TypeScript side to compute landmarks the same way, is
    the only direction available: the weights are already fitted to the TypeScript units, so making this
    file match them is a bug fix, and doing the reverse would re-introduce the nondeterminism that comment
    exists to keep out of the encoder.

    `MODEL_INPUT_VERSION` does NOT move for this. It versions the SHAPE of a dataset record (whether `parsed`
    exists, for instance) — see `assert_input_contract` above — and every training record was already built
    the TypeScript way, so this fix makes the live path match the contract it was always supposed to,
    rather than changing what the contract is. Recorded here rather than left to be inferred, because a
    version decision nobody wrote down is how the v18/v19 coupling became a release blocker (see the
    architecture audit, §4.2).

    `evidence-units-parity.test.ts` (`packages/scorer/src/`) is what keeps this from drifting from the
    TypeScript copy again: it spawns this file's own `evidence_units` over a shared table of captures and
    asserts the unit list is IDENTICAL to `evidenceUnits`'s, mutation-checked by re-adding this exact line.

    `require_release_eligible` exists because THREE callers need opposite things from the same guard, and
    treating them alike produced a circular deadlock that made a candidate impossible to evaluate:

      - INFERENCE must refuse an ineligible model. Scoring somebody's page with unvetted weights is the
        error this whole guard is for, and it stays the default.
      - THE ACCEPTANCE EVALUATOR must accept one. It exists to produce the evidence that DECIDES
        eligibility, and the trainer marks every fresh candidate ineligible precisely because acceptance
        has not run yet. So the gate that would qualify a candidate refused to run on an unqualified one,
        and no candidate could ever pass. Measured 2026-08-23 on the first candidate anyone evaluated
        through the lab interface; the shipped model predates it and was made by hand.
      - THE HARDENING CHECK is the same case: examining a candidate is not shipping it.
      - THE ABSTENTION SWEEP is the same case again, and it is a SUBPROCESS caller, which is why
        `--evaluating` exists. `calibrate-abstention.mjs` measures a named candidate against the held-out
        real pages; it shells out to this file, so it cannot declare its purpose at a Python call site. Its
        only route was `--allow-ineligible`, which the refusal message itself calls inference-only —
        so the honest options were to misuse an escape hatch or leave the sweep unable to measure a
        candidate at all. Measured 2026-08-24, the first time anyone pointed the sweep at one.

    Declared by the CALLER at the call site rather than passed as a flag at the command line. A job that
    must always pass `--allow-ineligible` is a guard nobody has — the same reasoning that kept `train` from
    always passing `--allow-overwrite`.
