// #1363 ACCEPTANCE: rehearsal 2's two real artifacts, driven through the real producer.
//
// Runs 34767932873 and 34768529975 in DanBeckDev/a11ign-v1-rehearsal ran the documented page and task,
// `https://www.w3.org/WAI` with "Learn about web accessibility". The probe opened the W3C's embedded YouTube
// player, the tab became youtube.com, and the report attributed what it then found to w3.org. Both
// `a11ign-result.json` files are committed verbatim under `fixtures/`.
//
// WHAT CAN BE DRIVEN FROM AN ARTIFACT, and what cannot: the Action's JSON carries the capture's transcript,
// structure and interaction, so the CLI's own cut (`examineWithinTheSite`), the rules layer (`ruleFindings`), the
// per-criterion outcomes (`criterionOutcomes`), the conformance scope (`conformanceFor`), the log line and the
// summary run on it for real. The trained scorer's half of the verdict needs its model runtime, and the capture's
// diagnostics were never uploaded, so neither is re-run here.
