/**
 * A CONSUMER WITHOUT `playwright` INSTALLED MUST NOT GET A SILENT RULE LAYER.
 *
 * The audit's own §7.1 finding was that the GitHub Action's axe layer went structurally dead and nothing
 * said so -- `ruleBased: null` on a run that never opted out, fixed by `assert-action-report.mjs --require-
 * rule-layer`. That fix covers the ACTION. This proves the same is true of the plain CLI, which a first
 * external user actually runs (`npx a11ign <url>`) on whatever machine they have -- one where
 * `playwright`/`@axe-core/playwright` failed to install, were pruned with `--omit=optional`, or were never
 * fetched because the registry was unreachable.
 *
 * `chooseRuleLayer` is the one place that decides. It is exercised here directly, not through a hand-built
 * report object standing in for its output -- `isolation-smoke.ts` already proves the RENDER half (an
 * `axe: null` report says "not run... unchecked"); this proves the DECISION half feeds it that value and
 * tells the user why, rather than swallowing the gap.
