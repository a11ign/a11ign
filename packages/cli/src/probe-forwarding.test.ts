/**
 * A PROBE FLAG DECLARED ON `Args` MUST REACH THE WIRE, THROUGH EVERY HAND-NAMED HOP IN BETWEEN.
 *
 * `probeFocusReveal` was declared on `Args`, defaulted to `true` (with an extensive comment explaining
 * why 1.4.13 needs it ON), and forwarded by NOTHING: `captureAndScan`'s destructure and type,
 * `recaptureUntilItReadsThePage`'s type, `runWitness`'s destructure, `CaptureRequest`, and
 * `captureViaWorker`'s own destructure and wire-body construction all named the other four probe flags by
 * hand and omitted this one. The result: the worker's own `probeFlags()` defaults an unsent flag to
 * `false`, so every CLI-driven capture ran with `probeFocusReveal` OFF despite the CLI's own stated intent
 * — silently, because an un-asked probe returns an empty channel, which is what a conformant page's
 * evidence looks like too.
 *
 * `probe-consent.test.ts` could not catch this: it compares `defaultArgs()`'s DECLARED VALUE against the
 * lab's real-page request body, so it correctly confirmed `probeFocusReveal: true` was declared — while
 * missing entirely that the declared value never reached `captureViaWorker`'s own wire body six lines away
 * in the same file. That is exactly the shape `probe-chain.test.ts`'s header names for a different pair of
 * hops: a test written against one boundary cannot see a drop at a boundary it does not cross.
 *
 * So this walks every hand-named hop BETWEEN `Args` and the wire, source-level (this file has no real
 * worker to capture against in CI, and the hops that matter here are internal parameter lists, not
 * behaviour a mock could exercise more honestly than reading the lists themselves).
