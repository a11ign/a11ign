/**
 * The CLI's own decisions, tested against captures a REAL screen reader produced.
 *
 * `cli.ts` had no tests, and the reason was structural rather than principled: it exported nothing, so
 * nothing could import it. "Capture needs NVDA on Windows" is true of the code that DRIVES NVDA and not of
 * the code that reads what NVDA said — and this repo has 2,122 real captures on disk. Mocking from
 * recorded output is not a compromise here; it is better evidence than an invented fixture, because the
 * shapes are ones the pipeline actually produces.
 *
 * Skips honestly when the corpus is absent, as `verify.corpus.test.ts` does — CI cannot see `runs/`.
 *
 * REPO-ROOT AND CAPTURES-PATH COMPUTED HERE, NOT IMPORTED FROM `@a11ign/lab` -- #199, chairman's
 * ruling. This file used to import `datasetRoot`/`captureRoot` straight from `@a11ign/lab/src/
 * dataset-paths.mjs`, which made `a11ign` (published, consumer-facing) depend on `lab` (private,
 * never published) -- a real boundary defect (ADR 0004), not merely a CI-scoping inconvenience: `lab`
 * ALSO depends on `cli` (`public-api.test.ts` imports the published package to verify its surface), so the
 * two depended on each other. `@a11ign/evidence` was considered as a shared home and rejected: ADR
 * 0004 states its contract explicitly -- "all contract, no I/O. Deliberately no `node:fs`, no
 * `process.env`" -- and every function this file needs reads `process.env` overrides. So this follows the
 * EXACT pattern `worker-fleet`'s `doctor.mjs`/`compare-workers.mjs`, `nvda-worker`'s
 * `capture-pure.corpus.test.ts` and `judge`'s `channel-tables-4.1.2.test.ts` already use for the identical
 * reason (documented in `dataset-paths.test.ts`'s own `EXEMPT` list): a local, duplicated computation
 * rather than an import that would create the cycle. Only the two env overrides this file's own read-only
 * existence check plausibly needs are honoured (`RUNS_ROOT`/`A11Y_RUNS_ROOT`, `DATASET_ROOT`) -- not the
 * full override surface `dataset-paths.mjs` supports, which this test has never needed.

/**
 * THE PRODUCT CLI GAINS THE SOCKET-LOSS RECOVERY EVERY LAB CLIENT ALREADY HAD —

 *
 * `captureViaWorker` used to POST synchronously with no `captureId`, so a response lost in transit meant
 * the page was reported as never examined even when the worker had already finished it. It now goes
 * through `captureTolerantly` (`@a11ign/worker-fleet/capture-client`), the same client every lab
 * capture already uses, which mints its own id and reconciles a lost acknowledgement or poll by asking
 * about that SAME id before ever giving up. Reproduced against a loopback worker exactly like
 * `capture-async.test.ts` does, at the real function this package calls rather than at a lower-level
 * helper: before this fix, this test's own worker (which destroys the response and finishes the capture
 * regardless) made `captureViaWorker` throw with zero recovery attempts.
