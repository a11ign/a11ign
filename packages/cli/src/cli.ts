/**
 * a11ign CLI (control plane).
 *
 * Runs the whole pipeline in one command: ask a capture worker to drive a real
 * screen reader through the page, then judge the announcement transcript here
 * (the judge is our OWN trained scorer by default -- `JUDGE_BACKEND` has defaulted to `local` since
 * 2026-08-04, so there is no metered API cost and no rented model in the path. This line said "the
 * local Codex login", which was true of the previous default and had outlived it; `codex`,
 * `anthropic` and `openai` remain available for comparison and are never the default.)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run witness -- <url> --task "..." [--worker http://host:port] [--json]
 * The worker URL also reads from A11Y_WORKER.
 *
 * With neither set, the run manages a local UTM worker VM on demand: it starts one if
 * needed and puts it back how it found it afterwards. See leaseWorker in @a11ign/worker-fleet.
 * Set A11Y_SHADOW_MODEL=1 to run the verified local screen-reader scorer beside the existing
 * judge. Shadow output is log-only and never changes findings.
