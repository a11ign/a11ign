/**
 * Imported axe results come in three shapes, and reading them wrong reports the wrong page confidently.
 *
 * `--axe-results file.json` lets someone supply an axe run they did themselves, so the CLI never scans twice
 * and never gives two differently-versioned opinions on one page. But axe's output has three legitimate
 * shapes in the wild — a results object, an array of them (one per page/frame), and a bare violations array —
 * and a parser that guesses wrong either throws on a valid file or, far worse, silently finds zero violations
 * in a file full of them. Zero violations renders as "axe ran and found nothing", which is a clean bill of
 * health this tool must never issue by accident.
 *
 * None of this was tested. Found by measuring coverage across every file rather than only the ones a test
 * loads.
