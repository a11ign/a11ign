/**
 * `launchBrowser`'s fallback, tested without a real browser or even real Playwright.
 *
 * FOUND 2026-09-06: `scanWithAxe` called `chromium.launch()` with no options, which needs the BUNDLED
 * browser — and the GitHub Action deliberately skips downloading it (`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`),
 * so on the Action `launch()` threw every time, `cli.ts`'s catch turned it into `ruleBased: null`, and
 * nothing anywhere asserted that `ruleBased` was ever populated. See `axe.ts`'s own header on `launchBrowser`
 * for the full account.
 *
 * `LaunchableChromium` is the injection seam: a fake object with just a `launch()` method, so this suite
 * needs no real Playwright and runs in milliseconds. `loadAxe()` itself (the dynamic import of the real
 * packages) is untested here on purpose — it is three lines of `import()` with nothing to get wrong that a
 * fake could catch, and mocking dynamic ES module imports is not worth the fragility for that.
