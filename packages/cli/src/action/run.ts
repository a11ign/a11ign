 * that was never there, in a place the guard for it could not look.
 *
 * `process.exit` stays inside rather than becoming a returned code. This IS the process's last act, the
 * exit codes are the Action's documented contract (2 = we could not look, 1 = findings met the
 * threshold), and routing them through a return value would put a second place where that contract can be
 * got wrong. What the wrapper buys is that the code no longer runs merely because somebody imported the
 * module.
