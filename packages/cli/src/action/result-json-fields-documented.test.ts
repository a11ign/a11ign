/**
 * #1637: nothing pinned the Action guide's `result-json` field table to the CLI's JSON printer -- a field
 * added to or removed from `printJson`'s output turned no test red, and the guide could go stale silently.
 *
 * This drives the REAL printer with a REAL recorded result (the rehearsal-3 fixture) and compares the
 * top-level keys it actually emits against the guide's table, read by HEADING rather than by line number,
 * as sets in both directions. Reading the printer's SOURCE with a regex was rejected: `printJson`'s body is
 * full of comments that themselves name fields in backticks (`` `verdict.runtime` ``, `` `structure` ``,
 * `` `interaction` ``, ...), which is exactly the comment-contamination `stripComments` was written to stop
 * (see its own doc comment) -- driving the function for real sidesteps that class of bug entirely.
 *
 * NESTED fields (under `verdict`, `outcomes`, ...) are OUT OF SCOPE, stated rather than silently skipped:
 * `verdict.findings` and `verdict.novelty` both collapse to the top-level key `verdict` on both sides of the
 * comparison, and this file makes no claim about what is under it.
