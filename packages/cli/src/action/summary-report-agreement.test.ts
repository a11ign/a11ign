/**
 * `report.ts` (the CLI's text report) and `action/summary.ts` (the GitHub Action's Markdown summary and
 * PR comment) are two independent renderers over the SAME verdict shape, and #796 measured them drifting:
 * `report.ts`'s own `verdictHeadline` already refused to print a bare "yes"/"no" for a backend whose
 * `taskCompletable` is not really an answer to a question about the task (the shipped `local` scorer) --
 * `action/summary.ts` did not, and posted "**No blocking findings** Yes" directly above six SERIOUS
 * findings on a real PR.
 *
 * Fixing `summary.ts` alone would leave the two renderers agreeing by coincidence, exactly as they
 * disagreed by coincidence before this row. This test feeds ONE fixture verdict to both and asserts they
 * state the same fact the same way, so a future change to either headline that stops matching the other
 * is caught here rather than on somebody's real PR.
