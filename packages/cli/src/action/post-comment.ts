// #493: "Could not post the PR comment. The job summary still has the report" used to print unconditionally
// on ANY `gh pr comment` failure -- including the one the V1 rehearsal hit on all three of its runs, where
// the build died before `run.ts` ever produced a summary at all. `run.ts` writes $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY and
// its `--summary-out` file in the SAME call, after the SAME early-exit checks (a missing/unreadable result,
// or a result with no verdict) -- so an absent summary FILE means the step summary is absent too, never
// just a different place the reader missed. This repo's own most-recorded fault class -- "a diagnostic that
// cannot report itself" -- pointed at a user instead of at us.
//
// Deliberately separate from `run.ts`, mirroring that file's own split from `action.yml`: the POLICY (which
// message, and whether the file genuinely exists) is testable here without a real `gh` call; the mechanics
// of actually posting stay in `main()`, which nothing but `action.yml` invokes.
//
// #567: NO WORKSPACE IMPORT, DELIBERATELY -- this file used to import `flagValue` from
// `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet/cli-flags`, which needs BOTH `node_modules` and a completed build
// (`pre-install-import-graph.test.ts`'s own header). This step runs `if: always()` in `action.yml`,
// specifically so it still reports when an EARLIER step failed -- and "Install a11ign" (the step that
// creates `node_modules` in the action's own checkout) is itself one of the steps that can fail or never
// run (measured live: the V1 rehearsal's #568, a `setup-node` cache step dying before "Install a11ign"
// ever starts). So the one step whose entire job is to report honestly on failure was, itself, silently
// unable to run under exactly the failure shape it exists to handle -- the identical class #535 fixed in
// `packages/guards/src/piped-exit-status-guard.mjs` the same day, missed here because this file was only ever tested
// inside this repo's own fully-installed checkout, never through the real composite-action path a
// consumer's workflow actually uses. `flagValue`'s own body is four lines; reproduced inline below rather
// than imported.
