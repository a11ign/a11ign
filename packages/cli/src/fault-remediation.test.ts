/**
 * Every fault code the worker can report must have remediation text here, or a stranger meeting
 * `(fault: screen-reader-mute)` learns nothing from it — see this file's own header for the incident.
 *
 * DISCOVERS the fault codes from `packages/nvda-worker/src/capture-faults.mjs`'s `FAULT`, by RELATIVE
 * PATH to its source, never a package import — `@a11ign/nvda-worker` is deliberately not a
 * dependency of this package (see `fault-remediation.ts`'s header), and even if it were, importing the
 * PUBLISHED package would resolve to a `dist` that could be stale relative to this worktree's source
 * (docs/backlog.md, issue #28's exact shape) — a relative import into `../../nvda-worker/src/` reads the
 * same source tree this checkout is testing, regardless of any package's build state.
 *
 * PLUS the one JUDGE-layer fault code (#81), read the same way but from Python source text rather than
 * imported (this package cannot `import` Python) — `score.py`'s `FAULT = "..."` class attribute, pulled
 * out with a regex rather than hand-copied, so a renamed fault code fails this discovery instead of
 * silently leaving a stale string here.
 *
 * PLUS the two `CaptureDoubt` values (#398) — CLIENT-SIDE judgements about an otherwise-successful
 * capture, not a worker-reported fault, but they share this table's WHAT/TRY/WHERE shape (see
 * `fault-remediation.ts`'s header for why). `packages/cli` already depends on `@a11ign/evidence` (`cli.ts`
 * imports `captureDoubt` from it directly), so this COULD import the type — but `CaptureDoubt` is a
 * TypeScript union, gone at runtime, and there is no runtime list to import. Scraped from source text
 * instead, the identical technique `judgeLayerFaultCodes` already uses one line below for the same reason.
