/**
 * ACTUALLY RUN IT, THROUGH THE SAME SYMLINK A REAL CALLER USES — architecture-audit.md §7.2: "the
 * published dist/cli.js bin is executed by nothing". Existence and a non-zero size are exactly what this
 * file asserted before, and neither would have caught the bug that shipped: `isProgram` compared
 * `import.meta.url` (which Node's ESM loader resolves through symlinks) against a NON-resolved
 * `process.argv[1]`. `os.tmpdir()` — where this gate itself runs, and where `npx` stages a package before
 * running it — is `/var/folders/...` on macOS, and `/var` is itself a symlink to `/private/var`. So the
 * installed bin ran, matched nothing, skipped `main()` entirely, and exited 0 with no output at all.
 *
 * `bin` above is built from `require.resolve()`, which — like `process.cwd()` after this process's own
 * `cwd` was set — is ALREADY realpath'd, so spawning it sidesteps the exact mismatch that broke a real
 * invocation and passes either way. `A11Y_ISOLATION_CONSUMER_DIR` is the one surviving copy of the RAW,
 * un-resolved consumer path (`isolation-gate.mjs` captured it before anything could canonicalise it), so
 * the bin is reached the same way a real `.bin` shim or `npx` cache entry would reach it. Falls back to
 * the resolved `bin` when run outside the gate (still proves execution, just not the symlink case).
