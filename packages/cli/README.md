# `a11ign`

Drives a **real screen reader** through a real page and reports the WCAG 2.2 AA failures a rule scanner cannot
see — the ones that need to know what a blind user actually heard, and whether they could still finish the task.

**Alongside axe, never instead of it.** Both layers run; neither subsumes the other.

**Two ways in that work today.** No install and no Windows machine of your own — add the action to a
workflow:

```yaml
runs-on: windows-2022          # NVDA is Windows-only; the action fails fast and says so otherwise
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v7
  - uses: a11ign/a11ign@main
    with:
      url: https://example.com/contact
      task: Send an enquiry
      fail-on: never           # report first; gate when your team asks for it
```

Or run it yourself from a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a11ign/a11ign.git
cd a11ign
npm install
npm run witness -- https://example.com --task "Find the opening hours"
```

**See the [top-level README](../../README.md) for which of those two paths is yours** — this file does not
repeat that decision.

> **`npx a11ign` works — `a11ign` is published to npm — and it still needs a Windows machine with NVDA.**
> `npx a11ign https://example.com --task "Find the opening hours"` is what the CLI *is*. It is not the first
> thing on this page because the machine it drives is the hard part, and which of the two ways in above is
> yours is decided in the [top-level README](../../README.md), not here. Check the current version with
> `npm view a11ign dist-tags.latest`.

## Which version you get

- **`npx a11ign` runs the `latest` tag**: the newest version that has passed the fleet's qualification.
- **`npx a11ign@next` runs the newest published version**, which is qualified later.
- **Read both with `npm view a11ign dist-tags`.** When `latest` is behind `next`, that version is waiting for its
  qualification, or failed it; a failure is a public row, so it is not silent. If you need the newest change and can
  take it unqualified, use `a11ign@next`.
- **A release is tagged `a11ign@<version>`**, for example `a11ign@0.5.3`, and its GitHub Release hangs off that tag. The
  `v<version>` tags are not that contract: they exist only so Dependabot can see the Action, and not every version has one.

**How long a merged fix takes to reach each**, as measured on one release and never as a promise:

- Measured 2026-10-07: a merge to `main` reached `next` in 40 minutes. That release's run was re-run once after a failed first attempt, so it is the slow case
  of a single reading, not an average. The commands and times are in
  [the reading on #3778](https://github.com/a11ign/a11ign/issues/3778#issuecomment-6043356294).
- Measured 2026-10-07: `next` to `latest` took 3.4 hours (about 207 minutes) on one release, `0.3.0`. That includes about 54 minutes of
  lab run, and a fleet that had to be woken first. It is a single reading, and `0.3.1` has been published since, so this is `0.3.0`'s
  figure and not the latest release's. The commands and times are in
  [the reading on #3778](https://github.com/a11ign/a11ign/issues/3778#issuecomment-6046521057).

## What "a rule scanner cannot see" means, concretely

Measured against the University of Washington "Accessible University" demo — a third-party, expert-built
inaccessible page and its accessible twin:

| | before (inaccessible) | after (accessible) |
|---|---|---|
| screen-reader layer | 1.1.1, 1.1.1, 4.1.2, **2.4.4**, **1.3.1** | none |
| axe | 1.4.3, 3.1.1, 1.1.1, 4.1.2, 1.4.1, 2.5.8 | none |

Two findings only the screen-reader layer produced, quoting what a user hears:

```
2.4.4 Link Purpose          heard: "click here, link"
1.3.1 Info & Relationships  heard: "102 announcements, no heading among them"
```

axe reports neither, and not by oversight: its `link-name` rule asks whether a link *has* an accessible name,
and "click here" has one. Meanwhile axe found four things a screen reader cannot perceive at all — contrast,
target size, language. That is the argument for running both, and the accessible twin being clean on both
matters more than either list.

## It will not tell you about anything visual

Contrast, focus-visible, reflow, target size: a screen reader cannot see them. Every report **says so** when
the rule layer did not run, because "we checked and found nothing" and "we did not check" must never look
alike. Reporting silence as a clean bill of health is the single most misleading thing this tool could do.

```bash
npx a11ign <url> --no-axe                    # screen-reader layer only, and the report says so
npx a11ign <url> --axe-results axe.json      # import a run you already did
npx a11ign <url> --json                      # machine-readable, for CI
```

## You need a Windows worker

The capture runs on Windows, with NVDA, in an interactive desktop session — that is not a limitation to work
around, it is what makes the evidence real. Point the CLI at one:

```bash
A11Y_WORKER=http://REDACTED-INTERNAL-ADDRESS:8765 npx a11ign <url> --task "..."
```

**UTM is DEPRECATED — it was a testing path, not the fleet.** `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet` can still lease a
local UTM VM on macOS and put it back as it found it, and every UTM entry point now says so at runtime. Point
`A11Y_WORKER` at a Windows machine you have, or use the GitHub Action if you have none. See
`docs/getting-started.md` for setting a worker up, and `@a11ign/nvda-worker` for the worker itself.

## Judging what the screen reader heard

By default the judge is a small trained scorer shipped with this tool — no API key, no metered cost, no
network call for the judgment itself. Point it at a rented model instead if you want a second opinion or
do not trust the local one yet:

```bash
JUDGE_BACKEND=openai OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... npx a11ign <url> --task "..."
```

`JUDGE_BACKEND=openai` speaks plain `/v1/chat/completions`, so it works against hosted OpenAI, Anthropic's
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or a local server (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp) — set `JUDGE_BASE_URL`
to point it somewhere other than `api.openai.com`. `JUDGE_API_KEY` is accepted as a project-neutral alias
for `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you would rather not put a provider's name on the variable. Other knobs, all
optional: `JUDGE_MODEL` (which model to ask for), `JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 120000), `JUDGE_REASONING`
(default `medium`, for models that support a reasoning-effort parameter). If a server rejects
constrained/structured JSON output, set `JUDGE_STRUCTURED=off` — most reject silently in ways that read as
a truncated or malformed response, so this is the first thing to try if `openai` backend responses look
corrupted against a self-hosted server.

`codex` and `anthropic` backends also exist, for comparison; none of the three rented backends is ever the
default.

## A page behind a consent wall is REFUSED, not reported

The screen reader gets held inside the modal, so the capture describes the dialog rather than the page.

**What the CLI actually does — this paragraph used to say "the run exits 2", and it does not.** It writes a
warning to stderr naming which kind of doubt it was, marks the result `captureVerified: false` with an
`unverifiedReason`, and **reports no findings rather than describing the dialog**. The report says so in
words. The run's exit code is decided by `--fail-on` as usual; the only thing here that exits 2 is a bad
`--forms` config. (Exit 2 on an unverified capture is `capture-check.mjs`, a lab harness, and this README
had inherited its behaviour.)

This is deliberate and it is the check that matters most in the whole tool: on one real site the census
found 793 links and 463 headings while the screen reader reached 1 heading and 0 links, and an earlier
version reported "No lived-experience findings" — for a page it had never seen. **Refusing to report is the
point; the exit code is not what does it.**

## Rendering the report yourself

```js
import { reportLines } from "a11ign";

console.log(reportLines(report).join("\n"));
```

`reportLines` and the `Report` type are the entire public API. Findings come back in the order a user meets
them — perceive, then navigate, then interact — because a finding about operating a control is not useful to
someone who could not perceive it.

The pieces underneath are packages in their own right: `@a11ign/judge` for the judgment,
`@a11ign/evidence` for the capture contract, `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet` for the VM lifecycle.
