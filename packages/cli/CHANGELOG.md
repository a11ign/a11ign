# a11ign

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- f7236ef: Every input of the Action is now passed to its scripts through the environment (`env:`) and none is interpolated into a `run:` script with `${{ inputs.* }}`. `task`, `forms`, `judge-backend`, `anthropic-api-key`, `judge-base-url`, `probe-forms`, `probe-focus`, `probe-navigation`, `axe` and `fail-on` were still expanded into shell text, GitHub's documented script-injection pattern: a `task` filled from an issue title or a pull-request body could close its quote and run commands on the runner. A test now fails on any `${{ inputs.* }}` inside a `run:` script (#4238).
- 0f2c191: The Action's multi-line `urls` input now scans every page it lists. With `urls: |` and one URL per line, as `examples/nightly-workflow.yml` and the docs show, a11ign 0.4.0 on a Windows runner scanned only the first page and reported success: a newline inside one argument does not survive `npx.cmd`. The list now reaches the CLI as one line, so the documented form scans every page. The `url`, `urls` and `max-pages` inputs also reach the scripts through `env:` rather than `${{ }}` inside `run:`, closing the script-injection shape (#4221).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2408d4f: **The Action's `probe-forms` input now defaults to `false`.** If your workflow relied on the old default, set `probe-forms: "true"` to keep submitting your forms with no valid input and reading what the page announces; a run that leaves it off logs that success criteria 3.3.1 and 4.1.3 were not assessed. `probe-forms` presses buttons, so `SECURITY.md` has a new section on running it against a staging app rather than production (#4108).
  
  A flows file may now list `idp-origins:`, the identity-provider origins a login passes through. Each must be an exact `http(s)` origin: a wildcard, a path, a credential, or your app's own origin is refused when the file loads. Those origins are allowed between the login's steps and nowhere else, so a run that ends parked on the provider is still reported as `left-origin` (#4106).
  
  The Action summary and the terminal report now name the WCAG 2.2 criteria the run did not cover (2.4.11, 2.5.7, 3.2.6, 3.3.7 and 3.3.8 on the recorded run) and say that their absence from the findings is not a pass (#4098).
  
  `examples/nightly-workflow.yml` is a scheduled workflow whose timeout and monthly budget are read from `docs/capture-cost.md`. It is an example only and changes nothing in the package's code (#4096).

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 9ff9120: The README now states the measured `next`-to-`latest` time (3.4 hours on one release), from a dated reading.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 22c28a4: The remediation text for `auth-login-failed` now says `expect-not-met` is also what a page that never loaded ends as, and that the message's step and `could not be loaded (...)` line say which of the two it was, so a reader is no longer sent to fix an `expect:` that was never evaluated (#4015). The set of login-failure reasons is unchanged.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f2e2697: `exports` and `bin` now point at `.mjs` (and `.d.ts` for types) where they pointed at `.js`, because the packages are built by Rslib instead of `tsc --build`: a deep import of `<package>/dist/<file>.js` stops resolving, and the CLI's `bin` is `./dist/cli.mjs`, so this is `minor` (a breaking change on a 0.x package) for each of the four. The CLI is also now one bundle that inlines `@a11ign/documents` (and the `pdf-lib` behind it) and `yaml`, so a consumer no longer installs them (#3580, ADR 0043).

### Patch Changes

- 744f3c0: Declares `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet` as `^0.3.0`, where it was the exact `0.1.4`: the fleet package is no longer a sibling in the workspace but a package released from its own repository, and the isolation gate refuses an exact pin to a non-sibling (#3504). Nothing else in the package changed.
- 176075d: The README now states which version `npx a11ign` runs (`latest`, or `a11ign@next` for the newest) and how long a merged fix took to reach `next`, from a dated reading.
- 6029cb6: Consumes `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet` `^0.5.1` where it held `^0.3.0` across four releases, in the root, `cli`, `guards` and `lab` manifests, with the lockfile at `0.5.1` (#3803). What each release changes for the core: 0.4.0 removes `a11ign-worker-deploy`, so the root's `worker:deploy` script, whose target `deploy-worker.mjs` is no longer laid, is removed with it (`fleet:deploy` is the deploy); 0.4.1 and 0.4.2 stop `a11ign-doctor`, `a11ign-worker-compare` and `fleet-env` resolving monorepo paths from inside an installed package, and the core runs them from the laid copy at the monorepo path, so nothing changes for it; 0.5.0 replaces `expectedWorkerCode()` with the async `resolveExpectedWorkerCode({ checkoutRoot })`, which hashes the layer clone when there is one, and `worker-code-check.test.ts`, the one consumer, asks the new function (#3781); 0.5.1 makes `doctor`'s `dist-freshness` read `missingExportTargets` instead of asking `tsc --build --dry` (#3810's fleet half).

  - @a11ign/screenreader-fleet@0.1.4

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- a1cbb8b: A scorer failure on a single `url` is now recorded as an unmeasured page, the way a failed page in a list is, instead of ending as a bare exit 1 with no result. The CLI writes the one-page result (`status: "failed"` with the scorer's reason) and the Action's Report step exits 2 with a summary, so a page that could not be measured is never reported clean. Authentication faults, worker faults and a shipped-artefact mismatch are unchanged (#3657).

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 4731fb8: `--json` now carries `sweepStarts`: the document each sweep began on, read from the capture's per-sweep `pageState` marks (served origin and path, never the query; absent when the capture has none). The job summary uses it to say which page the form-field sweep began on beside an asserted finding read from that list, keeping "may have been read on either" for entries after a pressed submit, since a start is not the page of a later entry (#3629).

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- a790870: An ASSERTED finding's row in the Action's summary now says where its evidence sits in the result: the JSON path of the entry (`transcript[36]`, `structure.formFields[4]`), the entries either side of it, and every identical entry. On a capture that names more than one document it also says the capture does not record which one the control was read on, and, when the sweep pressed a submit earlier in the same list, that it may have been read on either side of it. Until now a bare `edit` named neither the control nor its page (#3617). A referred finding's row is unchanged.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- bc05cfe: The Action's log now says how many criteria the rule layer (axe-core) failed, in a line before the count. The count line is the screen-reader layer's findings only, so a page axe-core failed on three criteria logged `a11ign: 0 finding(s) (none)` with nothing about the rule layer (#3616). No line is added when axe-core failed none.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c5e8151: `a11ign` now depends on `@a11ign/documents` by the range `^0.1.0`, the version `a11ign/documents` published, instead of the monorepo's workspace copy, which is deleted (#3125, move 6 of #69). A consumer installs the registry package, as the registry-consumer gate reads it.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ac0707: **You can now test a page behind a login (#2359, ADR 0038).** `--flows <file> --login-flow <name>` (the Action's `flows:` and `login-flow:`) run a form login from a flows file: named steps addressed by accessible name, in a closed vocabulary with no script step, the site's `origin:` pinned, and every secret taken from an environment variable the file names (`from-env:`), never from a flag or an input. The credential never crosses the worker's channel and is replaced with `‹credential›` (in its raw, URL-encoded and base64 forms, with the count disclosed) in everything the run writes or prints; a run that cannot keep it out ends with a named error and writes and prints nothing. An authenticated run presses only what its own files name (`probe-forms` and `probe-navigation` are turned off), says so before it starts, and lists what it pressed. It refuses a remote worker, a value under 8 characters, a non-local judge backend (unless `--send-authenticated-transcript-to-judge-vendor`), and, on GitHub Actions, a repository that is not private. MFA, SSO and CAPTCHA are out of v1: use a dedicated test account without them. See SECURITY.md and docs/github-action.md, "Logging in".
  
  **A URL or a task that contains a value from your login is refused before anything is captured.** Every output repeats the run's own URLs and task, and the server would log that URL, so a query token or a quoted password in either is a leak in its own right. The refusal names the variable and which argument, never the value (`auth-credential-in-artifact`).
- 377bd3c: The Action's `fail-on` threshold now counts asserted findings only. A referred finding (one the judge marks as needing a
  person's confirmation, outcome `cantTell`) is still listed in the summary and the log, but it no longer fails the run at
  any threshold, however it is rated. Previously a referral rated `serious` failed `fail-on: serious` while the log line
  called it referred. If you set a threshold, a run that failed only on referrals now passes. When a threshold is set, the
  log says so in one line: "fail-on counts asserted findings; referrals are listed and never fail the run".
- dcf4386: The first published version of `a11ign`. Everything below landed before it: the rename first, then oldest first.
  
  - The product is renamed: formerly a11y-witness, now a11ign. The npm scope, the unscoped CLI package, the
    binary names and every cross-package import specifier change with it (issue #66). Nothing had been
    published under the old name, so this is a rename landing in the tree before the transfer to the
    `a11ign` GitHub organisation, not a migration for existing consumers.
  
  - `packages/cli/README.md` gains a one-line pointer to the top-level README's routing decision ("which of
    the GitHub Action or the local path is yours"), replacing a paragraph that repeated the decision instead
    of deferring to it.
  
    ---
  
    **Why this is a `patch` and not `--empty`.** `npm pack --dry-run --json` puts `README.md` among the files
    `a11ign` ships, so it is consumer-facing prose, not an internal doc — the same category #229's
    changeset named: *"a packed file that IS the consumer-facing prose"* is a real changeset, unlike a
    packed-file change that is comments-only or a file npm never packs at all. The root `README.md` and
    `docs/getting-started.md` this same PR also touches are NOT packed by any published package (`npm pack
    --dry-run --json` from the repo root packs nothing outside `packages/*`), so only this one file's change
    needs an entry.
  
  - The human-readable report now says `asserted` and `referred` where it previously said `FAILED` and
    `NEEDS REVIEW` for a per-criterion outcome — worded per ceo's ruling on #242. The ACT vocabulary term
    (`failed`/`cantTell`) is named exactly once, in the legend's own parenthetical, never repeated at each
    finding.
  
    `--json` and the `ActOutcome` values it carries (`"inapplicable" | "passed" | "failed" | "cantTell" |
    "untested"`) are unchanged: `printJson()` never imports from `report.ts` and passes `outcomes:
    CriterionOutcome[]` through to `JSON.stringify` untouched, so a script parsing `--json` output is
    unaffected — only the human-facing text report's wording moved.
  
  - The first command on the README now works. It was `npx a11ign …`, which returns `E404` — nothing is
    published yet — so the first executable thing a reader met taught them only that the tool is broken. The
    page now leads with the two routes that work today: the GitHub Action, and a clone. The `npx` form is kept,
    below, labelled as what it will be rather than what it is.
  
    ---
  
    **Why this is a `patch` and not the `--empty` nearly every other changeset here is.** Of the 13 entries
    already in `.changeset/`, **12 are empty and the one that is not was written by a machine** —
    `promote-candidate-0d498ef6.md`, a `major` on `@a11ign/scorer` that `promote:model` wrote itself. So
    this is the first hand-written entry in the repo to declare a bump, which is worth stating rather than
    slipping in. The closest precedent — `capture-probes.mjs`, a packed source file — reasoned that a consumer
    received different bytes but not different behaviour, so `--empty` was honest. That entry's own table names
    three categories; this is a fourth:
  
    | | |
    |---|---|
    | a packed file whose behaviour changed | a real changeset |
    | a file npm never packs | the gate should not fire (#132) |
    | a packed file, comments only | `--empty` is honest |
    | **a packed file that IS the consumer-facing prose** | a real changeset — this one |
  
    `npm pack --dry-run --json` puts `README.md` among the 55 files in `a11ign`'s tarball, so it ships;
    and unlike a comment, a README is not inert to the reader — it *is* what the consumer reads first. A change
    that takes its opening command from broken to working is a change to what they receive, even though no code
    path moved.
  
    Recorded rather than left to silence, per `.changeset/README.md`: `changeset status` cannot tell "nobody
    wrote one" from "somebody decided", and only one of those is a decision.
  
  - The GitHub PR comment (`packages/cli/src/action/summary.ts`) no longer prints the raw ACT vocabulary
    term `cantTell` at a reader who has no legend to explain it — worded `referred` instead, per ceo's
    ruling on #242 (PR #252). Unlike the CLI's own terminal report, there is no legend here to house even
    one parenthetical ACT mention, so the term does not appear at all in this renderer's output — a
    stricter bound than #242's "exactly one occurrence, in the legend."
  
    `--json` and `ActOutcome` are unchanged: `printJson()` (`cli.ts:719`) has zero references to
    `report.ts`, and `summary.ts` reaches the `outcomes` field independently through its own path — a
    script parsing `--json` output is unaffected.
  
  - The hard capture timeout now carries a fault code (`hard-timeout`) instead of an untagged `Error`, so a
    CLI reader gets a plain-language explanation — "the capture ran too long and was abandoned" — instead of
    the generic no-remediation path. The message also names how far a partial capture got (the last recorded
    progress phase, and how many progress marks were recorded) when the worker reported one, so "we ran out
    of time partway through" and "we could not read your page at all" read as the different findings they
    are. Additive on the wire: an older CLI reading a fault code it does not recognise already falls back to
    "no remediation recorded" rather than failing, and an older worker's untagged timeout error is unaffected
    by either side of this change.
  
  - The warning printed when a capture cannot be trusted to describe the requested page (a consent overlay
    the tool could not dismiss, or content that still doesn't match the page's title after retrying) now gets
    the same WHAT/TRY/WHERE remediation a worker fault does, instead of a bare sentence — issue #398. The
    underlying judgement is unchanged: this only makes the message actionable.
  
  - #168: removed each package's own `"prepare": "tsc --build"`. Nothing a consumer installing the published
    package observes -- `prepare` never ran for a registry install in the first place (only `prepack`, which
    still runs `tsc --build` unchanged, ships the tarball). This only affects `npm ci` inside this monorepo:
    three packages' own `tsconfig.json` reference the same `evidence` project, so npm firing all five
    workspaces' `prepare` scripts concurrently could start several independent `tsc --build` processes writing
    to `packages/evidence/dist/*` at once -- a real file-write race, source of the intermittent `ci/ts`
    failures. The root's own `prepare` now runs `npm run build` once, coordinating the same dependency graph
    through a single `tsc --build` invocation instead.
  
  - `npm run witness` now writes the capture it took to `runs/witness/<stamp>-<slug>.json` and prints the
    path as the last line of its report (or as an `artifactPath` field alongside `--json`), so a run that
    goes wrong — a consent overlay, a page that reads short, a timing that surprises you — leaves you a real
    file to send someone or open with `npm run capture:explain`, instead of only a printed report. This is
    ON by default; pass `--no-keep` to skip the write, which is confirmed explicitly rather than silently
    doing nothing.
  
  - Fixed the copyable GitHub Actions workflow in this package's README: it was missing an `actions/checkout` step, so a reader copying it exactly got an empty workspace and the Action never reached the page.
  
  - Fixed #493: when a run failed before producing any report at all, the Action's PR-comment step used to
    print "Could not post the PR comment. The job summary still has the report" — false, since nothing was
    ever produced. It now says so honestly, naming the real cause, and keeps the original message for the
    case it was actually written for (a report exists, but posting the comment itself failed).
  
  - Fixed #567: the Action's own PR-comment step (`if: always()`, so it still reports when an earlier step
    failed) crashed with `Cannot find package '@a11ign/worker-fleet'` whenever that earlier failure happened
    before `npm ci` had run in the Action's own checkout — which defeated the honest "no report was produced"
    message #493 added, since the step that would print it died on import first. The Action no longer depends
    on a workspace package to report its own failure.
  
  - `npm run witness` now prints an early, in-flight notice within roughly a minute of capture start when a
    page looks like it is heading toward a "contained" doubt (a consent overlay Escape could not dismiss) —
    previously this warning only appeared after the whole capture finished, which could be several minutes
    later with no intervening output.
  
    The early reading uses the SAME threshold `captureDoubt`'s finished-capture verdict already applies
    (`@a11ign/evidence/verify`'s new `earlyContainmentVerdict`), read off marks the worker's `/progress`
    endpoint already reports — nothing new is recorded by a capture, and no cached evidence is affected. The
    notice is purely informational: it never changes whether or how a capture proceeds, and prints at most
    once per capture. `earlyContainmentVerdict` and its `EarlyContainmentVerdict` type are additive exports.
  
  - Fixes a real defect that produced a nonsensical, published "44 headings swept against a ground truth of 1"
    report — a capture of calendly.com whose form probe activated its own "Continue with Google" button,
    navigating to `accounts.google.com`'s sign-in screen before the browser's element census was taken. NVDA's
    sweep had genuinely read calendly's real 44 headings; the census, taken after the whole sweep at the time,
    described Google's page instead — and the report treated the census's tiny count as calendly's real total,
    printing "reached in full".
  
    Two changes:
  
    - `packages/nvda-worker/src/capture-probes.mjs`: the census is now taken before ANY probe capable of
      navigating the page (previously only before `probeRouteChange`, which missed the opportunistic form
      probe's own activation — the actual cause here). The census reads the accessibility tree over an
      already-open DevTools socket, never NVDA, so this changes WHEN a diagnostic snapshot is taken, not what
      a capture hears; `CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` is untouched.
    - `@a11ign/evidence/conformance`: a census whose CDP target could not be confirmed (`targetMatch:
      "fallback"`) is now refused for any sweep-versus-census comparison, and the report states plainly that
      the census likely describes a different document rather than treating its count as ground truth. New
      export `censusTargetMismatchReason`; `censusFromDiagnostics` also refuses a fallback-target census.
  
  - The early consent-overlay-style notice `npm run witness` prints during a capture (added in #676) now
    reads a different, earlier diagnostic mark and no longer names "consent" specifically.
  
    `earlyContainmentVerdict` previously waited for `structureCensus`, which #426's own fleet measurement
    found lands at the very END of a capture — its timestamp equalled the total capture duration in all nine
    real captures measured, so a verdict waiting on it is never early. It now reads `pageState`'s raw DOM
    element count (recorded immediately before the structural sweep, well before a capture's later probes
    run) against the same `structural` mark as before, discriminating the identical real cases 80-90 seconds
    sooner: verified against three real captures (theregister.com and hubspot.com as positives from two
    different mechanisms, en.wikipedia.org — the slowest of the three — as a control that must not fire).
  
    The notice's own wording no longer names a consent overlay as the cause: hubspot.com fired it from an
    unrelated mechanism, so a consent-specific sentence would have been wrong on a real page that triggered
    the same, honest "reached almost none of this page" finding.
  
  - Every capture can now say WHICH document it was served, and two captures of one URL are no longer
    indistinguishable (#687).
  
    `environmentKey()` keys a capture on everything about the environment — browser, OS, architecture, NVDA,
    guidepup, screen-reader settings, the provisioning revision, the protocol version — and, for corpus
    pages, on the page directory. It recorded nothing about what the server actually sent. Measured on
    `https://calendly.com/`, two captures eight minutes apart on one worker: one was served Google's sign-in
    wall (the form probe activated "Continue with Google"), the other `calendly.com/scheduling`. Both records
    say `url: "https://calendly.com/"`.
  
    `documentIdentity()` derives that identity from marks the capture already carries — the served URL from
    the census marks, the title from `titleSource` — so **every capture already on disk has one**, including
    the two above. Nothing new is observed and no second copy is stored.
  
    - **`evidence:check` and `gate:stability` refuse rather than compare.** A pair served different documents
      is a distinct outcome (`DIFFERENT_DOCUMENT`), never a list of field differences: those differences are
      all true and all irrelevant, and they send a reader after the capture pipeline when the cause was the
      page. `summarise` excludes such a pair from the sample and reports the run inconclusive.
    - **The report says which render it describes.** WCAG Requirement 2's limitation has always read "one
      viewport, one state, one document" without ever saying which; it now names the served path, the title
      and the element counts.
    - **The document identity is NOT a cache key,** and two tests now say so with the reason. Adding it would
      invalidate 2,122+ captures to guard a population that is empty: real-page captures never cache, and the
      corpus's pages are generated into a directory the key already covers.
  
    The counts are reported and deliberately not compared: a real page recaptured an hour later has moved
    links and is the same document, so deciding identity on counts would refuse most of the population this
    runs against.
  
    The served path is origin + path, because a sign-in URL carries per-request nonces and two captures of one
    wall would otherwise differ every time. Each capture records HOW MANY query parameters were dropped —
    the count, never the values — so a "same document" verdict says where it rests on origin and path alone.
    `docs/known-gaps.md` §46 records what that costs: a site whose documents differ only by query string reads
    as one document here.
  
    One finding fell out of measuring the records rather than reasoning about them: the 10:42 capture carries
    eleven `titleSource` marks, ten saying "Sign in - Google Accounts" and the last saying "Privacy Notice
    Calendly". A capture whose own marks name two documents has no single identity, and the report now says
    so rather than silently taking the first.
  
  - The per-field activation gets its own budget, and a control it never reached is no longer reported as a
    control that said nothing (#677 part 2).
  
    `formField` is the third of eight sweeps and the only one carrying an `onItem`, and that `onItem`
    activates a control and waits for speech. Measured over three real captures, taking 180 ms/trip — what
    every other sweep type costs — as the sweep's own price and attributing the excess:
  
    | capture | fields | sweep | attributable to the activation |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | calendly, `probeForms` on | 18 | 57.2 s | 49.0 s (86%) |
    | calendly, `probeForms` off | 46 | 138.7 s | 119.3 s (86%) |
    | ikea | 100 | 322.3 s | 283.0 s (88%) |
  
    On IKEA that consumed the whole capture: `formField` stopped on `deadline` and the five sweeps after it —
    `graphic`, `link`, `list`, `frame`, `postSubmit` — each returned `deadline` having examined nothing. **Two
    structural types out of eight**, and `postSubmit` is where 3.3.1 and 4.1.3 live.
  
    The activation now stops at **half of what remains when its sweep begins**, so the sweeps after it keep at
    least as much as it takes. One number, and it is the one that moves if the fleet measurement disagrees.
    **The unit is a five-second wait, not a millisecond**: the cost divides out at 4.5–8.8 s per activation
    against `STATE_WAIT_MS` of 5,000, so a budget buys a count of waits and covers fewer controls than a
    reader would expect.
  
    Controls the budget refused are **counted and reported**. A refused control produces no `formChanges` and
    no `stateChanges` — byte-for-byte what a control that announces nothing produces — so the report now says
    `40 of 100 form control(s) were NOT ACTIVATED`, and says every control was offered when none were refused.
  
    **Also corrected: the coverage sentence was comparing unlike with unlike, and said it was not.** It
    promised "distinct announcements against DISTINCT NAMES the browser reports — like compared with like",
    but `distinct` collapses by name and an element with **no** name counts as its own. Measured: calendly
    `graphic=63, graphicUnnamed=38, distinct=61` (two collapsed); ikea `graphic=205, graphicUnnamed=0,
    distinct=165` (forty collapsed, correctly). So the reach denominator invented a shortfall in our own
    report on any page with unnamed elements.
  
    The two sentences now use two denominators, because they ask different questions:
  
    - **`NOT EXAMINED (of N)`** counts every element on the page. An unnamed graphic that was never examined
      is unexamined.
    - **`reach R/N`** counts only what a sweep could ever have announced — `distinct` minus the unnamed.
  
    A nameless element is excluded from **reach** and never from **assessment**: 1.1.1 is one of the four
    subtypes this project may assert, and its evidence is the unnamed count itself. Captures predating the raw
    census fall back to exactly what they reported before.
  
  - `npm run bench:capture -- --from-disk --sweeps` answers #659: **the sweep cost is what seeing the page
    costs.**
  
    `sweep` is the largest phase on every real page measured and the only one that scales — 78.5% of one run
    on its own. That is the case for looking, not evidence of waste: `collectByType` walks the page by
    quick-navigation and that is how this tool sees structure at all.
  
    A phase total could not answer it. One phase covers eight sweep types, and one of them (`formField`)
    carries a per-field activation the other seven do not — summed, that type's behaviour is everybody's.
    Split by type, across six pages replayed from captures already on disk:
  
    ```
    type        pages  thin  rates (median ms/trip)      spread  cause
    formField       4     2  222, 1261, 323, 463            5.7  per-step
    graphic         4     2  162, 146, 180, 174             1.2  per-element
    heading         3     3  173, 180, 165                  1.1  per-element
    landmark        3     3  165, 157, 171                  1.1  per-element
    link            3     3  178, 189, 184                  1.1  per-element
    list            2     4  200, 220                       1.1  per-element
  
    walk rate (every type with no onItem): 163 ms/trip
    ```
  
    **Every sweep that only walks runs at the same rate on every page**, across pages differing by an order of
    magnitude in element count. The total is trips times a constant, and trips is how many elements there are.
    `formField`'s excess over 163 ms/trip is its activation, not a slower walk — and on the two most recent
    captures it reads **190** and **202** ms/trip, which is the walk rate, because the probe cost nothing on
    those pages.
  
    Two things the replay found in its own first output, both now guarded:
  
    - **A sweep that never ran was contributing `0 ms/trip`** — a starved sweep records `found: 0`, `ms: 0`
      and two baseline round trips, so a naive divisor made it the fastest sweep in the set. Read from the
      stop reason now, never inferred from `ms === 0`.
    - **A page whose sweep barely moved was setting the verdict.** One page whose heading sweep found ONE
      heading reported 345 ms/trip against 180 on the page with eighty — the rate was highest where the sweep
      found the least. Pages under 20 round trips are excluded and **counted**, and the floor is measured
      rather than chosen. It changed `heading` from `per-step` to `per-element`.
  
    `--from-disk` also now reads both record shapes. A `runs/witness/` record wraps its capture, so pointing
    the tool at the directory #659's own Region names reported "No captures with diagnostics" over 24 of them.
  
  - Fixed the GitHub Action's PR comment printing "**No blocking findings** Yes" directly above findings marked
    serious when using the default local judge. The headline now states the count instead (e.g. "none; 6
    finding(s) below that severity"), matching the CLI text report's own wording -- a bare yes/no is shown only
    for backends (anthropic/openai) that actually answer a question about the task.
  
  - A 4.1.2 finding is no longer asserted from a before/after pair that names two different controls (#812).
  
    `probeDisclosure` activates a control and records `after` from `reportCurrentFocus` — **whatever holds
    focus afterwards**, not a re-read of the control it activated. Those coincide only when activation leaves
    focus put, which is why this held across 2,000+ corpus captures and broke on a nav menu that moves focus
    into what it reveals. The V1 rehearsal's only 4.1.2 finding was:
  
    ```
    control  "…, list, with 6 items, Platform, button, collapsed"
    after    "Outline, menu button, focused, collapsed, sub Menu"
    ```
  
    Both say `collapsed`, so the state comparison passed **across two different controls**. The literal
    `focused` token is `reportCurrentFocus`'s own output: the capture was saying which question it answered,
    and nothing read it.
  
    `addSilentStateChanges` now establishes **identity before state** — the announced names must match, and an
    empty name is not an identity. The guard reads the announcement strings, which every capture already
    carries, so it applies retroactively with no protocol bump and no recapture.
  
    The claim this makes is narrow: **the capture never made the observation such a finding rests on.**
    Whether that control exposes its state change is unknown, not disproved.
  
    The capture also records `afterSource: "focus"` so the record says which question it answered in a field
    rather than in a comment, and `probeDisclosure`'s comment no longer promises a re-read of the control or a
    read of the accessibility tree — it never did either. Making `after` a true re-read needs a CDP read of
    the activated element and is an evidence change: a separate row.
  
  - Every sweep now fingerprints the document it is about to walk, and the report can say **which** sweep a
    mid-run navigation happened during (#758).
  
    `documentIdentity` (#687) gives a capture one identity; `targetMatch` (#699) says whether the census
    described the requested page. Neither localises a navigation that happens *during* the run — and two
    fingerprints per capture bracket **eight** sweeps, so a capture that moved could be seen to have moved and
    not to have moved anywhere in particular.
  
    `documentChangedDuring` reads the served URL from each `pageState` mark and names every boundary the
    document changed across. On the two calendly captures already on disk:
  
    ```
    probeForms ON    sweep -> focus   calendly.com/  ->  accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier
    probeForms OFF   sweep -> focus   calendly.com/  ->  calendly.com/scheduling
    ```
  
    **Both arms navigated** — the "probeForms off" arm reached another calendly page, so it did not hold
    still, and only the per-sweep `found` counts (link 82 against a census of 76, versus link 5) say the ON
    arm's sweeps were the ones walking the other document. That correction came from writing the reader: the
    first version compared element counts and reported a change in both arms, which is true and useless
    because a page that lazy-loads content changes its counts without changing document. **Identity is the
    served URL, not the shape** — the same distinction #687 had to draw, one level in.
  
    `collectByType` now calls the existing `markPageState` as `sweep:<type>`, at the **one** place every sweep
    reaches the page, so `sweepEveryStructuralType`, `sweepExtraTypes` and `rescanFormFieldsAfterSubmit` are
    all covered by a single line and `probeStates` groups them for free — no new mark, no new comparator, and
    `FINGERPRINT_KEYS` still spelled once.
  
    The granularity is reported rather than assumed: with per-probe marks the answer is "between sweep and
    focus", a window containing eight sweeps; with per-sweep marks it names the sweep. Reporting the first as
    though it were the second would be invented precision.
  
    `pageState` also records `tookMs`. Its own header calls the fingerprint cheap, and this adds one per
    sweep to what is already the largest phase of a real page — so the cost of the instrument is now a number
    in the next capture rather than a claim in a comment.
  
  - #800 asked whether IKEA serves 265 form controls or the sweep walks more than is there. **Neither is
    established, and the reason is that the question cannot be asked of any capture on disk: the two numbers
    describe different moments and one of the instruments moves the page it measures.**
  
    `sweepAgainstCensus` compares each sweep's `found` against the census's **raw** element count — never
    `distinct`, which #737 established counts nameless elements as separate names. It issues **no verdict**
    from these captures, and the ratios are reported with the reason:
  
    ```
    type        ratios (complete sweeps only)   completeness   verdict
    formField   --   --   --   2.17 2.12        t t t c c      not-simultaneous
    graphic     --   --   1.41 1.41 --          n n c c t      not-simultaneous
    heading     0.96 0.96 1.16 1.16 1.16        c c c c c      not-simultaneous
    landmark    0.86 0.86 0.86 0.86 0.86        c c c c c      not-simultaneous
    link        --   --   --   --   --          n n t t n      not-simultaneous
    ```
  
    **This corrects what #836 merged.** That PR shipped "the honest answer is NEITHER — the question
    presupposes a shared denominator and the instruments do not have one", and the mechanism was wrong.
    **#699 merged at 12:40:39Z, into the middle of the five-capture set**, moving the census read from after
    the probes to before them: two captures measured what was present once the sweeps had walked the page,
    three measured it before anything touched it, and nothing in the record says which. The 0.45-to-2.12
    inversion is the instrument crossing a code change.
  
    **And the field used to date the instrument is the field the instrument misreports.**
    `structureCensus.atMs` is stamped at MARK time, so it puts the census last on all five captures — which is
    how the first answer came to say "#699 isn't in any of them" when it is in three. That is why this gates
    on simultaneity rather than on a corrected stamp.
  
    **Two distinctions had to be built before that was visible, and each changed the answer once.**
  
    **A ratio only means anything from a sweep that ENDED.** `sweepCompleteness` draws three states:
    `exhausted` and `silent` are a sweep running out of elements; `deadline`, `cap`, `error` and
    `focusModeStuck` are a sweep being cut off, and its `found` is a lower bound. Read without that,
    `formField` gives `0.45 0.45 2.27 2.17 2.12` and looks like a comparison changing sign; three of those
    five are truncations. These are `examinationState`'s three states (#677), one level down at the sweep.
  
    **A ratio only means anything if both sides describe the same moment.** The census is read at t≈0 and
    `formField` walks at t≈300-400 s, activating 64 controls while it walks — so on a lazy-loading page every
    ratio above 1 is the page growing between two reads, and nothing here can tell that from over-walking.
  
    **`heading` is the nearest thing to a control and shows why.** No `onItem`, walks at ~100 s, and it
    announces **80 on all five captures** while the census reports 83 then 69. A numerator holding still under
    a denominator that moves 17% is not that numerator's control.
  
    **The gate is not permanent and not a placeholder.** It opens on `readAt.startedAtMs` — the field #854
    adds, which no capture on disk carries,
    because `structureCensus.atMs` is stamped at MARK time and the census is read at the top of
    `navigateByStructure` and marked after it returns, so that field is off by the whole capture. A test pins
    the behaviour the fix unlocks so the gate cannot quietly become permanent.
  
    One thing ruled out cleanly: **the sweep is not double-counting.** All 265 announcements on the 14:31
    capture are distinct, and still 265 after normalising away every state word.
  
    `sweepNeverRan` and `sweepCompleteness` live in `sweep-costs.mjs` as the one place that decides how far a
    sweep got, because a second spelling is how two readers drift apart.
  
  - **`structureCensus.atMs` said the census was read at the END of the capture. It was read at the start —
    and on 25 of 25 captures in one checkout's `runs/witness`, the field landed within 60 ms of the last mark
    in its file.** The error is the whole capture: 93 s to 469 s, median ~310 s.
  
    `createDiagnostics`' `mark` stamps `atMs` inside `entries.push`, so `atMs` is when the mark was PUSHED.
    That is right for a phase mark, whose push *is* the event, and wrong for the three census marks: they are
    read by `censusBeforeNavigating` at the top of `navigateByStructure` and pushed by
    `navigateByStructureThenAudit` after every sweep and probe has run.
  
    **Three marks, one read site, one defect.** `structureCensus` is the one that misled a reader;
    `domCensus` and `mediaCensus` are read in the same call and pushed in the same place, and nobody had yet
    asked them the question.
  
    **What it cost.** Comparing `structureCensus.atMs` against the first sweep's mark to decide which side of
    #699 five IKEA captures fell on produced *"#699 isn't in any of them"* — it is in three. That reading
    closed #800 with the wrong mechanism (#850 corrects it) and blocks #844. **The field used to date the
    instrument was the field the instrument misreports**, and it agreed with the reader until it didn't.
  
    **The fix is a new field, not a corrected one.** `atMs` keeps meaning what it has always meant: correcting
    it would make old and new records look alike while meaning different things, and no correction reaches a
    capture already on disk. Each census mark now carries `readAt: { startedAtMs, tookMs }` — the start *and*
    the duration, because a read is an interval and only the pair says how wide it is. Consumers gate on the
    PRESENCE of `readAt`; `populationVerdict` (#850) is the consumer this unblocks.
  
    **Nested, not flat, and that is load-bearing.** `censusElementCounts` and `censusFromDiagnostics` build
    the element counts by taking every numeric field on the mark except `event` and `atMs` — a denylist. A
    flat `readAtMs: 3200` would have arrived downstream as an element type named `readAtMs` with 3,200 of
    them. A test in `packages/evidence` pins the other end of that agreement, so flattening it breaks where
    the damage would be done.
  
    **`createDiagnostics` had two copies and they were about to disagree.** It lived in `capture-core.mjs`
    and `capture-setup.mjs`, duplicated deliberately to avoid an import edge that does not exist — both files
    already import `capture-pure.mjs`. It lives there now, as one exported function, which is also what makes
    it drivable by a test: the guard proves the fault is real by marking a value read 25 ms earlier and
    asserting the two moments differ, rather than describing that in a comment.
  
    **Not an evidence change.** Diagnostics are not evidence: no announcement, no `structure`, no
    `interaction` moves. `CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` is untouched and no cached capture is invalidated — older
    records simply lack `readAt`, which is the state the consumer already handles.
  
    Checked and not in scope: `markPageState` already marks immediately after its read and carries `tookMs`,
    so its `atMs` is honest — it is the pattern this copies.
  
  - **A probe's comment says what it READS, and nothing compared that against the calls it makes.**
    `probeDisclosure`'s said *"We RE-READ the control… Re-reading asks the accessibility tree instead"*; the
    code calls `reportCurrentFocus`, so `after` is whatever holds focus after activation. The two coincide
    whenever activation leaves focus where it was — true on 2,000+ corpus captures, false on a nav menu that
    moved focus into what it revealed, where the judge asserted 4.1.2 across two different controls.
  
    `probe-comments-match-their-reads.test.ts` classifies every probe function three ways: `no-claim`,
    `consistent`, `contradicted`. Only the third fails, because "makes no claim" and "makes a claim that
    holds" are different facts and a guard that conflates them reports the wrong population.
  
    **The row's population figure is corrected rather than repeated.** It said "13 claims across 15 probe
    functions". Measured here: **15 probe functions, 28 lines anywhere in the file matching the phrase sweep,
    and 2 probes whose own comment makes a READS claim.** The 13 was a count of matching LINES — the search
    space, not the finding, the same distinction `bounded-window-reads.test.ts` had to draw. **That is not a
    smaller problem than the row described**: one of the two claims was wrong, it survived 2,000+ captures,
    and nothing in the tree could see it.
  
    **Delegation is followed one level.** `probeToggle` and `probeTaskButton` are one-line dispatches to
    `activateAndCaptureDelta`, so a body-only scan sees them read nothing and would call any claim they make
    contradicted. A scanner that cannot tell "reads nothing" from "reads through a helper" produces a false
    accusation — measured: with delegation-following disabled, a claim on `probeToggle` is reported as a
    defect that is not there.
  
    **The floor asserts about the search.** Every other assertion is satisfied by finding fewer probes, so the
    fifteen are written out by name; a renamed or deleted probe fails loudly rather than shrinking the
    population silently.
  
    Not in this change: correcting the comments the guard classifies. It finds one `consistent` claim and no
    `contradicted` one today — `probeDisclosure`'s was corrected by #812 — so there is nothing to fix, and
    each future correction is its own change with its own evidence.
  
  - **`probeFocusOrder` reported `cycled` at 14 stops and `truncated` at 90 on the same requested URL ten
    minutes apart, and the two walks were on different websites.**
  
    ```
    capture    stops  verdict     the document the walk actually ran on
    12-49-29     14   cycled      accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier
    12-59-26     90   truncated   calendly.com/scheduling
    ```
  
    Across the eight calendly captures on disk the split is **4/4 with no exception**: every `cycled` walk ran
    on Google's sign-in page, every `truncated` walk ran on a calendly URL. `probeConfiguredForm` activates
    "Continue with Google" and the focus probe runs afterwards — the #685/#691 mechanism, one probe further on
    than the census fix (#699) reached.
  
    **The census cannot contradict it and is not wrong to fail to.** It reads at t≈0 and correctly reports
    `targetMatch: matched` for calendly; the walk happens ~300 s later somewhere else. Every mark is truthful
    about its own moment, and the capture as a whole reads as one page.
  
    **So the `focusOrder` mark now records which document it walked.** `pageState(focus)` (#758) already
    fingerprints it, but as a separate mark joined to this one only by ordering — and 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.4.1,
    2.4.3 and 2.1.4 all read `focusOrder` as evidence about the requested page. The URL is read **before** the
    first Tab, for the reason `censusBeforeNavigating` is where it is.
  
    **The row's hypothesis is refuted, and stating that is part of the answer.** It expected `cycled` at 14 to
    be a FALSE COMPLETION, since `focusOrderCycled` compares phrases — the ambiguity `sweepInDirection`
    refuses in its own comment. Measured on **all 16 `cycled` verdicts in the corpus: every one is a genuine
    ring return**, the opening three phrases appearing at exactly two indices, `0` and `length - 3`, never in
    the middle. The ambiguity is real and nothing in the corpus shows it firing, so nothing is changed on
    suspicion.
  
    **And the same table forced a second finding.** IKEA reports `stops: 0` on every capture with `cycled`,
    `stalled` and `truncated` all false — three booleans over four loop exits, so "the first Tab announced
    nothing" and "this page has no tab stops" arrived identically, beside the same capture's
    `focusConfinement` mark reporting `controlsOnPage: 265`. The walk now records **why** it ended
    (`cycled`/`stalled`/`silent`/`deadline`/`cap`), and `sweepOutcomes` reports a `silent` walk so 2.1.2 and
    2.4.3 get a `cantTell` instead of a clean channel from a probe that never read one.
  
    `truncated` keeps its exact meaning, derived from the stop reason rather than recomputed, with a test
    driving both formulas over every combination — it is what `sweepOutcomes` turns into the `cantTell` that
    stops 2.1.2 claiming an unearned pass, and narrowing it would quietly convert those into assertions. The
    new outcome gates on the PRESENCE of `stop`: a capture taken before this cannot say which ending it had,
    and inventing truncation in old evidence is the wrong direction to be wrong in.
  
  - **#71's two defects are fixed on `main` already. What was missing is that nothing checked either one, and
    the code said otherwise.**
  
    `resolvedPageUrl` is module-level, and `pageTarget()` reads it at the TOP of `navigateExisting` — so a
    value surviving from the previous capture makes capture N+1 of page B ask
    `choosePageTarget(expectedUrl = B, resolvedUrl = A)` while the reused window still shows A. **It fails in
    the direction that looks like success**: A is a real URL, so nothing throws and nothing reads as absent.
    `A11Y_REUSE_BROWSER` is on by default, so that is the normal path.
  
    The fix moved `resolvedPageUrl = null` to the first statement of the function, and its comment said
    *"`browser-session.test.ts` pins the ordering, because a statement's POSITION is the property here and
    moving it back is a one-line edit that changes nothing a type or a lint check can see."*
  
    **It did not.** Measured: moving the reset back inside the `try`, exactly where it used to be, failed
    **none** of that file's 16 tests. A comment naming a guard that is not there is worse than no comment,
    because it stops the next reader looking — the #842 shape, in the file whose whole subject is a guard, and
    about the one property the comment itself says nothing else can see.
  
    `resolved-page-url-reset.test.ts` pins it now: the reset is the **first** statement, it precedes
    `pageTarget()`, and it resets to `null` and never to the requested URL — `resolvedNavigationUrl` returns
    the requested URL when nothing redirected, so resetting to it would make "nothing redirected" and "a
    previous capture redirected here" the same value. That is the trap that makes the obvious fix wrong, and
    the row names it explicitly.
  
    **The row's first defect — the gate comparing with `!==` — is settled rather than assumed.** It uses
    `sameDocument` today, and the comment beside it argues the two cannot differ: the branch is reached only
    when nothing matched `expectedUrl`, so if `resolvedUrl` is the same document, nothing could match that
    either. The argument is sound (`sameDocument` reduces to `normalise(a) === normalise(b)`, and equality of
    a function's outputs is transitive by construction) and it was prose. A test now drives the exact input
    the row predicts — a resolved URL differing from the requested one only by normalisation — and both
    spellings give `fallback`.
  
    **Still open and not in this change: acceptance 4, the two-page capture.** `evidence:check` samples the
    synthetic corpus, whose pages do not redirect, so the predicted fields were structurally unable to move.
    The designed test is `w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/survey.html` and `tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/`, and it
    **belongs to whoever drives the fleet**.
  
  - **A link sweep reported `exhausted` — the one stop reason this codebase treats as authoritative — after 8
    trips, having found 1 link on a page whose own census counts 79. The report then rendered "every
    structural sweep ran until the page ran out of elements".**
  
    **The cause is in the capture's own phrases.** The `landmark` sweep before the collapse ends on
    `"Chat Widget, region, ... Open live chat, button, opens dialog"` and then `"Hub Bot, dialog"` — it walked
    into HubSpot's chat widget and left the cursor inside an open dialog. Every sweep that ran while it was
    open exhausted that dialog, truthfully:
  
    ```
    formField  12 found — every one a chat-widget control ("Ask me anything...", "send message",
                          "Resize widget height or width", "Close live chat")
    graphic     2 found — "Avatar of Hub Bot", "Message History ... Avatar of Hub Bot"
    link        1 found — "privacy policy, link"
    ```
  
    Then the `list` sweep found the real page's 22 lists and the `frame` sweep saw the widget as
    `"... opens dialog"` — closed again. **Nothing was wrong with the page, the worker, the build or the
    sweep**, and the same capture's `heading` sweep found 28, exactly as the healthy captures did.
    `exhausted` is NVDA's own "no next link", and it is true about wherever its cursor is. This is #863's
    finding one probe over: a verdict about a scope nobody recorded.
  
    **The check names the number it compares and needs no threshold: a sweep cannot have visited more elements
    than it made trips.** 8 trips against a census of 79 is arithmetic. `ranOutShortOfTheCensus` reports every
    sweep whose directions both ran out while its total trips fall short of the same capture's census for that
    type, and Requirement 2 withholds the full-page sentence, naming the numbers:
    *"link (1 found in 8 trips, census 79)"*.
  
    **It withholds a claim rather than asserting incompleteness, and the sentence says so.** The census counts
    AX nodes in roles a quick-navigation key may never reach — #800's finding about `formControl` and `f` — so
    short trips do not prove anything was missed. They prove the affirmative claim is not supported.
    Withholding needs doubt; asserting needs proof.
  
    **This is already on disk, and not rarely.** Run over every capture in one checkout's `runs/`, **14 of 32
    captures would lose the full-page claim** — including four captures of `theregister.com` reporting
    `link 0 found in 6 trips` against a census of **788**, each of which currently renders a full-page
    completeness sentence. *That reads a local copy of `runs/`, so it is a PRE-CHECK: the authoritative number
    belongs to whoever drives the fleet and the lab.*
  
    Gated on the presence of `prevTrips`/`nextTrips`: a capture that does not record them cannot answer this
    question and is not made to. Only sweeps whose BOTH directions ran out are considered — a half-exhausted
    sweep is already truncated and `truncatedSweeps` reports it, and counting it here would report one
    capture's incompleteness twice.
  
  - **A row's Acceptance saying `npm test` is now refused at FILING, by the same function that refuses it at
    PR time.**
  
    `pr-open` already caught the only instance — *"needs `corpus`, which this job does not have —
    abstention-regression.test.ts requires corpus via compareAtFloor"*. The acceptance job has no token and no
    corpus and runs commands taken from a body, so the whole suite is not something it can run. **A row's
    acceptance is written before anybody knows which job will run it**, which is why it has to name the files
    the change is verified by rather than the command a developer would type. Asking at filing puts the cost
    on whoever still has the context; by PR time it is a rewrite of a section written hours earlier by
    somebody who has moved on.
  
    **One implementation, and that is the change rather than a side effect of it.**
    `template-fields-rule.mjs` imports `runsTheWholeSuite` and `extractAcceptanceSection` from
    `acceptance-commands.mjs` unchanged, so the same command string gets the same answer at both times. A test
    drives both entry points over the same strings and asserts they agree — with a guard that the string list
    contains both verdicts, since "they agree" is satisfied by a list where nothing is the whole suite.
  
    **Only the command-shape half lifted, deliberately.** `jobCapabilities(body)` and
    `unmetCommandRequirements` read a PR body and the capabilities a job declares; at filing time there is
    neither, so the requirement half stays where it works. A weaker second copy of a check that already works
    is the defect this row exists to avoid.
  
    **The constraint that was expected to decide the shape does not apply, and that is now asserted rather
    than remembered.** The row was scoped around `template-fields-rule.mjs` being a pre-install entry — where
    an `@a11ign/*` import is refused, and `region-paths.mjs` was extracted rather than imported for exactly
    that reason. Measured: `row-file.mjs` and `row-claim.mjs` are invoked by no workflow at all, so neither is
    a pre-install entry and the direct import is available. A test fails if a workflow ever invokes one, and
    says what to do about it.
  
    **It fails by MISSING, and the limit is stated in the code.** `runsTheWholeSuite` is a positive test for
    two spellings, `npm test` and `npm run test:ts`. A third spelling of the same thing — a shell alias,
    `npm run test --workspaces`, a Makefile target, `node --test` with the glob written out — reads as "not
    whole-suite" and is then classified by the files it names, which for a command naming none is nothing to
    check. Moving the check earlier moves that miss earlier too. It stays silent rather than inventing data,
    and the honest remedy is a check on what a command RUNS rather than a longer alternation.
  
    Presence and content stay separate refusals: a row with no Acceptance is refused as missing it, never as
    naming the wrong command.
  
  - `npm run lab:full-page-claims` counts how many real-page captures lose Requirement 2's full-page claim
    under #894's `ranOutShortOfTheCensus`, and names the sweep that withheld it, per page.
  
    Added as a lab job (`lab:job -e job=full-page-claims`) rather than a local script, because it reads
    `runs/real-page-corpus`: a copy in any other checkout is only as fresh as its last sync, so a corpus-wide
    count is a verdict only when the lab runs it. That is CLAUDE.md's "a gate that reads `runs/` is not yours to
    report", and this is what lets the rule be obeyed rather than worked around with a loop over SSH.
  
    Counts "cannot say" separately from "says no": captures with no usable census, and captures predating #887's
    `trips`, are reported as their own totals rather than folded into the clean or the failing side.
  
  - **A sweep now records what it was sealed inside, so `exhausted` in a dialog stops reading as `exhausted`
    on the page.**
  
    #887 stopped the report claiming a full page over a collapsed sweep, by comparing trips against the
    census. That is the consequence. **This is the cause**: on `runs/781-r1-hubspot.json/capture-1` the
    `landmark` sweep's last stop is literally `"Hub Bot, dialog"` — it walked into HubSpot's chat widget and
    left the cursor inside an open modal. A screen reader's quick navigation is confined to one, so every
    sweep that ran while it was open exhausted the DIALOG, truthfully: `formField` 12 chat-widget controls,
    `graphic` 2 Hub Bot avatars, `link` 1 against a census of 79. Then the dialog closed, `list` found the
    page's real 22 lists, and the same capture's `heading` sweep found 28 — as many as the healthy captures.
    **Nothing was wrong with the page, the worker, the build or the sweep.**
  
    The DOM census reports `openDialog`: the **name** of an open modal, or `null`. `markPageState` already
    fingerprints the document before each sweep (#758), so it returns what it read and `collectByType` puts
    the scope on the `sweep` mark itself — **no extra round trip**, and the verdict and the scope it is about
    are one record rather than two joined by position (#863's finding). `ranOutInsideADialog` then withholds
    Requirement 2's full-page sentence, naming the dialog: *"these sweeps ran out of the DIALOG rather than of
    the page: link (inside "Hub Bot")"*.
  
    **A string, never a count**, and that is load-bearing: `censusElementCounts` builds the element counts
    from every numeric field on a census mark except two, so a numeric `openDialogCount` would arrive
    downstream as an element type. A label also points a reader at the thing to go and look at, where a `1`
    does not.
  
    **Modal only.** A `role=dialog` without `aria-modal` does not seal quick navigation, and `<dialog open>`
    is not `showModal()` — only the second matches `:modal` and only the second is inert-backed. Reporting
    either would mark sweeps that were never confined, which is the false-accusation direction.
  
    **Measured on the captures on disk, and the answer is a partial correlation rather than a rate.** By
    inference from phrases (the field itself exists on no capture yet), a sweep ends on a dialog announcement
    in **9 of 33** captures — eight of them calendly's cookie banner. Cross-tabulated against #887's
    trips-short check: **5 end in a dialog and later sweeps run short, 4 end in a dialog and the later sweeps
    are fine, 7 run short with no dialog at all.** So the mechanism explains at most 5 of 12 collapses, the
    phrase evidence over-reports because `role=dialog` is not `aria-modal`, and **7 collapses have another
    cause still unaccounted for**. *A local `runs/` copy, so this is a PRE-CHECK; the authoritative figure is
    the fleet operator's.*
  
    **A worker deploy is required before any capture carries the field**, so the fixture proves the defect
    happened and the synthetic-DOM test proves the field detects it — joining them needs one capture taken
    after the deploy.
  
  - **Two changes that #922 was approved with and merged without** — the PR merged between the reviewer's note
    and the commit answering it, so they arrive here instead.
  
    **`checkVisibility` now runs on BOTH dialog branches of the DOM census.** It was explicit on the
    ARIA-modal branch and implied on the native one. `:modal` normally does imply rendered — a top-layer
    dialog — but `showModal()` followed by `display: none` stays `:modal` and shows nothing. The stronger
    reason is worker-judge's: **a check explicit on one branch and implied on the other is a difference the
    next reader has to reason about**, and it costs nothing to not make them. A test covers the native case.
  
    **And the asymmetry sentence in `ranOutShortOfTheCensus` is sharpened** — *"Withholding needs doubt;
    asserting needs proof"*, with what each direction costs when wrong: being wrong here costs a claim nobody
    was owed, while being wrong the other way puts a completeness sentence over a page that was never read.
    Deferred from #894 for the next change touching that function rather than shipped as a PR that rewords a
    comment.
  
    Comment and guard only; no behaviour change beyond the `display: none` modal case.
  
  - **#844 closes on "still no, and here is the number" — a bound rather than an absence.**
  
    #800 asked whether IKEA serves 265 form controls or the sweep walks more than is there. #850 refused any
    verdict because no capture recorded WHEN its census was read; #854 added `readAt.startedAtMs` so they
    could. **The answer that unlocked is worse than unknown: on the 14 captures now carrying it, the census
    lands at 28–67 s and the `formField` sweep walks at 37–280 s.** Knowing both moments proves they are not
    the same moment. A gate that opened merely because the moments were recorded would have read *"we can see
    the gap"* as *"there is no gap"*.
  
    **The control the row named is what opens it instead.** `heading` carries no `onItem`, so the sweep
    changes nothing, and a heading is a heading in the DOM, in the accessibility tree and to NVDA alike — no
    role argument reaches it. **A `heading` ratio of exactly 1 is direct evidence the page did not change over
    that interval**, whatever its length, and it replaces a threshold on time that somebody would have had to
    choose. `populationVerdict` now refuses without it; every row carries `sweptAt` and `apartMs`, so the
    comparison is labelled at the point it is produced rather than in a document.
  
    **A ratio below 1 is not a shrinking page.** hubspot's `heading` reads 0.04 — the sweep was sealed inside
    a chat dialog and exhausted it (#897). The control returns "could not report" rather than answering about
    the page, so a reader is not sent looking for growth that never happened.
  
    **Acceptance 3 reproduced, and gained a control the row did not have.** The heading gap is positive on
    salesforce (+5) and ikea (+11), and **exactly zero on eight w3.org captures** — the census and the sweep
    agree precisely when the page holds still.
  
    **And the row's first option is refuted by measurement.** The DOM census beside the AX one:
  
    ```
    capture       DOM formField    AX formControl    sweep found    heading ratio
    ikea                     51               136            270             1.16
    salesforce                7                18             27             1.11
    tfl                    1392                15             34             1.00
    w3.org                   15                15             15             1.00
    ```
  
    **On ikea and salesforce the AX bucket is already wider than the DOM's form elements** — 136 against 51 —
    so widening `FORM_CONTROL_ROLES` moves the denominator further from the page. **And tfl rules out page
    growth on its own**: `heading` reads 1.00 while `formField` reads 2.27, with 1392 DOM form elements above
    both. Three instruments, three populations, on one still page.
  
    The decision is recorded where the census is defined: option 1 refused, option 2 cheap and unable to
    attribute, and **only recording the role each announcement came from can tell a narrow bucket from a
    growing page** — the successor row.
  
  - **`fleet:status` no longer prints CONSISTENT over a subset of the fleet.**
  
    It compared only the boxes that answered and printed `fleet CONSISTENT` over them, with the reachability
    count on a separate line — so a reader saw a verdict and a count as two unrelated facts. **An unreachable
    box that has drifted read as agreement.** Measured: the status said CONSISTENT over nine boxes while the
    tenth, excluded for not answering, was `a11y-worker-4` on Windows `10.0.26200` against the others'
    `10.0.22631`. The OS is a capture-cache key, so the fleet was not one fleet, and five captures (#29) were
    taken on the divergent box before anyone noticed.
  
    **The verdict now carries its denominator and has three states, two of which must not collapse:**
  
    ```
    fleet CONSISTENT across 10 of 10 — these workers are interchangeable for capture
    fleet UNKNOWN — the 9 compared agree, and 1 of 10 could not be compared …
    fleet INCONSISTENT across 4 of 4 — windowsVersion differs …
    ```
  
    "Nine agree and one did not answer" is a box to reach; "they disagree" is a fleet to re-provision.
  
    **The denominator is the number COMPARED, not the number that answered — the same defect one level
    down.** `fleetConsistency` drops a guest that reports no `environment` before comparing, so a box can
    answer `/health` and still not be in the set the verdict is about. It now returns `compared` (additive;
    `doctor` and the existing tests read only `consistent` and `mismatches`), and the verdict is denominated
    by it. Denominating by the reachable count would have fixed the instance and left the class.
  
    **The JSON field `consistent` is renamed `comparedAgree`**, and a `verdict` object carries the answer. A
    bare `consistent: true` over nine of ten is the exact misreading this fixes, one serialisation away; no
    code in the repository read the old field.
  
    `doctor`'s own fleet check already said "N of M guests agree … the rest could not be asked" — it learned
    this first, and the command whose whole job is to describe the fleet never did.
  
  - **A tree-walking guard can now declare the subtree it walks, and its own run proves the declaration.**
  
    `alwaysRunTests` runs every guard whose population is discovered from the tree, on every pull request,
    because a file added anywhere can join such a population. That stays exactly as it is. Measured by running
    all 131 always-run guards under the new observer: 38 walk the whole repository and 69 read inside a product
    package, but **24 read nothing a product diff can touch**. Six of those read nothing outside their own
    imports at all, and five of the six are flagged only because they import `packages/agent-org/src/ready-label-audit.mjs`,
    whose `run("git", ["for-each-ref", …])` the static predicate reads as a walk.
  
    A guard may now write `export const WALK_SCOPE = ["docs"];`, and `narrowByDeclaredScope` leaves it out of a
    run whose diff touches none of it. **Undeclared means unbounded**: a guard that says nothing is kept on
    every diff exactly as today, because the failure mode of a wrong narrowing is a guard that silently stops
    running. The narrowed guards are reported **by name** beside `alwaysRunCount`, never folded into it.
  
    **The declaration is checked by the guard's own run, never trusted.** `packages/guards/src/walk-scope.mjs`, imported
    first, records every path the process lists, opens or tests — sync, callback and `fs.promises` alike, plus
    `git` by its pathspecs. **A read it cannot see fails closed**: any other child process, a shell pipeline, an
    unknown `git` subcommand and a listing of the repository root all count as the whole repository.
    `declareWalkScope` fails the guard's own test file if anything it read lies outside what it declared. The
    check runs exactly when the guard runs, at no extra process cost.
  
    **First batch: five guards, all outside the triage churn** — `verdict-adoption`, `recorded-provenance`,
    `real-page-corpus-freshness`, `capture-body-owner` and `merge-method-is-one-fact`. On a product diff the
    always-run set goes from 131 to 126; on a `scripts/` diff the lab-scoped four are left out and the
    `scripts/` one stays. The other 19 bounded guards are a follow-up: most live in
    `packages/lab/src/packaging/`, where the open guard-triage rows are still deciding what to delete.
  
  - **A landmark sweep that stopped fewer times than the page has landmarks is now reported as short, even when
    none of its announcements could be read as a landmark.**
  
    It used to read "cannot say", and a finding treated "cannot say" as a full examination. On a page whose
    named form Edge 152 announces as a "section", the sweep stopped once where the page has two landmarks, and
    a criterion could pass as if the page had been examined in full. It now reads as short, so the pass is
    withdrawn to "can't tell". A sweep that stopped as many times as there are landmarks, or more, still
    reads "cannot say": a stop is not always a landmark, and counting stops would invent a complete sweep.
  
  - The Homepage link on each package's npm page now points at the project's repository rather than at `a11ign.com`, which does not resolve. Clicking it from npm previously went nowhere; it now reaches the source, the README and the issue tracker.
  
  - **When a probe's activation takes the browser off the page's site, a11ign now ends the examination there.**
    That includes a new window or tab, or a URL on another origin. Nothing observed after that point is reported
    as the page's.
  
    **What a report says about it.** The log line reads `examination ENDED -- left the site at "<control>"`
    before the finding count. The summary leads with the same, and Conformance Requirement 2 names what was not
    examined. The JSON result carries a new top-level `leftSite` naming the control, and where the browser went
    when that is known.
  
    **Controls inside an embedded frame or object are no longer activated.** On the page the docs recommend,
    `https://www.w3.org/WAI`, the probe used to open the W3C's embedded YouTube player. Every sweep after it ran
    on youtube.com, and its one serious finding was reported against w3.org.
  
    **For the published types:** `@a11ign/evidence` exports `leftSite()` and `withinTheSite()`, and
    `CaptureInteraction` gains an optional `leftSite`. A capture made before this is still recognised from its own
    announcements ("Opening new window").
- 51640ea: **You can now load a saved sign-in instead of performing one (#2632, #2566, ADR 0038 amendment 7).** `--auth-state <file>` (the Action's `auth-state:`, beside `flows` and `login-flow`) loads a Playwright storage state you saved by signing in by hand, in place of the login: the cookies and `localStorage` for the run's own origin go in through the same browser-protocol calls in the screen reader's browser and in the rule layer's, the login flow's final `expect:` is asked of the page the run requested, and a state that no longer holds ends the run with `auth-state-expired` and captures nothing. A single-sign-on session that has expired ends the same way, and a CAPTCHA on the page is still `auth-challenge-detected`. The worker is sent a path and nothing else and reads the file itself; every value the state loaded is hidden from what the run writes and prints, and values under 8 characters and values you gave the run yourself are counted and said, not hidden. The tool never writes the file. `sessionStorage` is not in a state file and IndexedDB is not loaded, so a site that keeps its session there cannot be carried. Not yet measured against a real site. See SECURITY.md and docs/github-action.md, "Logging in with a saved state".
- 85cc880: **A run can now capture a list of pages, and two URLs are no longer one silent capture.** `witness <a> <b>` used to keep only the last URL and capture nothing about the first, with no word of it. It now captures both, in the order given, or refuses. The Action takes the same list as its new `urls` input, one URL per line, and exactly one of `url` and `urls` must be given (both or neither is refused before any setup is billed). A list of one behaves exactly as a single URL always did.
  
  **The count comes first, and the cap is explicit.** Before any capture, and before any worker is leased, the run prints `N captures, about X minutes` with the file the estimate comes from (`docs/capture-cost.md`). A list above 5 captures is refused, naming the cap, the count and the override: `--max-pages N` on the CLI, `max-pages` on the Action, 25 at most. Nothing else raises it: no environment variable and no config file. On the Action the refusal names the cost in runner-minutes billed to your account, because there you pay for them. This is a list you write, not a crawl.
  
  **Every page is reported on its own.** `--json` for a list is `{ "multiPage": true, "pages": [...] }`, one entry per URL in order. The Action's summary opens with a roll-up saying which pages tripped `fail-on`, then each page's report. A page whose capture fails is shown as failed, the pages after it still run, and it is never reported as clean. With a `forms` config, every URL is checked against the config's origin before the first capture (#2272).
  
  **A failed page no longer hides the report.** The Action's capture step used to stop at the CLI's exit 1 for a list in which a page failed, so the summary that names the failed page never ran. It now records the status, the Report step renders every page, and the job fails after the report exists. A PDF in a list is reported as not measured rather than crashing the outputs step.
- e7de1e1: **A second layer, alongside the screen-reader and rule-based ones: `@a11ign/documents` reads a PDF's own
  accessibility tag tree (#68, ADR 0036).** Point `a11ign` at a URL ending in `.pdf` and it reads the
  document's `/MarkInfo`, `/StructTreeRoot` and struct-element dictionaries directly -- no browser, no NVDA,
  no fleet -- and reports whether the document is tagged at all, whether it declares a language, and whether
  its `Figure` elements carry alt text. Findings appear in a new `-- PDF layer --` section of the report and
  under `pdf` in `--json` output, labelled with their layer exactly as axe-core's findings already are.
  
  This is #68's own test of the layer model ADR 0036 describes: a second, genuinely different evidence
  source joining through the same `Report` shape, with no change to `@a11ign/evidence` or `@a11ign/judge`.
  It held -- the PDF layer needed a new field on `a11ign`'s own `Report` type and nothing else.

### Patch Changes

- eaa8ae3: **A login that stops at a CAPTCHA now ends in a named fault, `auth-challenge-detected`, instead of an unexplained `expect-not-met` (#2564).** It NAMES the challenge and never answers one: nothing clicks a widget, waits it out or works round it, and solving a CAPTCHA is refused by design. Both interpreters (the CLI's, and the worker's `auth-flow.mjs`) check only where a login or `flow:` step has ALREADY failed, a control that cannot be found or an `expect:` not met: if the page that failed it renders an iframe served from a reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha or Cloudflare Turnstile host (the hosts each vendor's Content-Security-Policy page documents), the failure is reclassified, with the step's own reason kept in the sentence. It never turns a success into a failure, so a dashboard carrying a reCAPTCHA v3 badge or an invisible Turnstile still passes its `expect:`. The read is a new fixed page-side call on both drivers (`frameSources()`, the `src` of the iframes the main document renders); the accessibility tree could not answer it, since an `Iframe` node carries only a `title` that no vendor documents. It is a fault and not a fourth `auth-login-failed` reason. `AUTH_FAULTS` goes from eleven to twelve, with a `FAULT_REMEDIATION` entry naming the dedicated-test-account route, and a worker `FAULT` code. **Not done:** the requested page after the login and the capture proper (no hook, and not ordered), a vendor other than the three, a widget in a shadow root or a nested frame, a frame that is not rendered, and a reCAPTCHA v3 badge cannot be told from the v2 checkbox, so a page that also failed for an unrelated reason is reported as the challenge.
- 785519a: **A multi-page run behind a login now REPORTS the logins it performed, states its cost as a minimum, is bounded, and stops on a failed login (#2562).** `--urls` and `--login-flow` already composed and nothing tested it; the shipped code differed from ADR 0038's prose in four places. (1) **The count is a result.** It is counted where a login is sent (each worker capture attempt, re-captures and `--forms` states included, and each rule-layer scan), reported as `logins` in `--json` (`performed`, `workerAttempts`, `ruleLayerScans`, `minimum`) and as a closing `Logins: N performed` roll-up line. **Measured on a fake worker: 3 pages, axe on, one page re-captured once = 7 performed (4 worker attempts + 3 rule-layer scans).** (2) **The pre-run notice is a MINIMUM and says so** ("at least 6 logins"), counted per capture and not per page, so form states are no longer undercounted, and it names the worst case (each capture up to `MAX_CAPTURE_ATTEMPTS` = 3 attempts). It matches the ADR's "at least two logins per capture"; "N captures are N logins" was the floor of a run with no repeats, and "pages x 2" is a floor and never a count. (3) **A lockout guard** refuses BEFORE any lease when the minimum passes `MAX_LOGINS` = 20 = `DEFAULT_MAX_PAGES` x (`MAX_CAPTURE_ATTEMPTS` + 1), the default run's worst case: the default 5-page run (minimum 10) is admitted, 25 pages (minimum 50) is refused, exit 2, naming the constant and the count. **It has no override** (a flag would reach the Action's inputs); the remedies named are a shorter list or `--no-axe`. (4) **A failed login stops the list**: after an authentication fault, later pages are recorded `notAttempted` with the fault named and make no login; a capture timeout still continues. A worker-reported authentication fault now reaches the caller as an `AuthError`, so a single-page run that fails to log in exits 2 (the caller's to fix) rather than 1. Not built: ADR 0038's per-entry `flow:` / `auth: none` list. Not in this change: naming a page that bounces to the login wall mid-run (`auth-session-lost`).
- 39ce854: **A run that ends `auth-state-expired` now says which layer refused the saved state (#2820).** A run holds two layers that each load the page in a browser of their own, the screen-reader worker's and the rule layer's, and until now the error read the same whichever of them refused. When the worker refuses, one line on stderr now names it and says what the rule layer did: refused the state too, accepted it, failed for another reason, or did not run (`--no-axe`, or imported results). The error's own message is unchanged, and the line carries nothing from the state, a header or the page.
- 246a95c: **A page the trained scorer declined to score no longer reads as a clean page in the GitHub Action's comment (#3294).** On `https://www.gov.uk/` (run 37134253796) the scorer abstained (nearest training similarity 0.6476 against a 0.6557 floor), and the comment's bold headline still said "No lived-experience findings" with "No blocking findings: none", which a reader who stopped there took as a page that was read and found fine. An abstained verdict now renders "**Not scored: no lived-experience verdict for this page**" and "No blocking findings: not scored"; a scored page with no findings renders exactly as before. `docs/try-it.md` names abstention as a fourth tell that a zero count is not yet a clean read.
- 4dd7dcc: **A run shown the login wall after a successful login now ends in a named fault, `auth-session-lost`, instead of being captured as a broken page (#2563).** Both interpreters (the CLI's, and the worker's `auth-flow.mjs`) read the accessibility tree of the page the run landed on, after the requested page loads and before `authApplied` is marked; if EVERY control the login flow fills is on it (found by accessible name, `within:` honoured), the run was shown the login form, whether by a same-origin redirect (which used to end as the generic `wrong-page`) or in place (which used to be captured as the page). The signal is the form, not the flow's `expect:`, which holds on the dashboard and on no other page. A page carrying one control named like one login field (a change-password page) is not the wall, and a login that fills nothing never trips it. It is a fault and not a fourth `auth-login-failed` reason: the login succeeded. `AUTH_FAULTS` goes from ten to eleven, with a `FAULT_REMEDIATION` entry and a worker `FAULT` code. **Not done:** the main frame's tree only (a login form in an iframe is not seen), one read (a wall rendered later is not seen), and one-session-per-account invalidation of the rule layer's login is not measured.
- cdb132c: **A single-URL authenticated run reports the logins it performed, in the shape a page list does (#2645, #2561 finding a).** The run stated a login floor before it started, counted a tally the whole way and dropped it: only `runPages` built the report, so the floor could not be compared with what the run did, which is the very lockout risk the docs ask a reader to weigh. `--json` now carries `logins` (`performed`, `workerAttempts`, `ruleLayerScans`, `minimum`) on the result (on the LAST result when a forms config runs several states, the tally being cumulative), and a run with no JSON result, or one that threw after logging in, says the list's `Logins: N performed …` line on stderr, beside the notice that stated the minimum. An unauthenticated run reports nothing, and a list's report is unchanged. Not decided here: whether a single URL should state a minutes estimate.
- 5d3ed42: **`witness`, `worker:compare` and `auth:leak-check` say "did not answer within 12 s", never "down" or "unreachable", and wait long enough for the slowest healthy box (#2683).** Each probed `/health` with its own number (5 s, 8 s, 10 s) and reported a timeout in words that called a slow box gone. A new `@a11ign/worker-fleet/probe-outcome` reads a probe as ready, busy, not-ready, refused or no-answer; a refusal and the box's own `ready:false` say the box is up, and silence names `npm run fleet:wake -- <name>`. The shared timeout is 12 s: the loaded ceiling (about 10 s) plus 2 s, against a slowest healthy first-after-idle answer of 3.09 s (`orchestrator`'s readings on #2671, not measured by this change). `worker:compare` also now says why a worker has no vitals instead of leaving the column blank.
- 04ce2bd: **The Action's `task` input is optional, and says what it does (#2268, #2262 ruling a).** It names a button for the probe to press, by a word from that button's label; it is a label for the report; and it does NOT change the analysis. An unset input reached the CLI as `--task ""`, and `argv[++i] ?? args.task` only falls back on a missing value, so an optional input left unset would have run with an empty task and printed a blank `Task:` line. The workflow now passes `--task` only when the input says something, and the CLI treats an empty or blank `--task` as no task. The report's `Task:` line and the summary's `**Task:**` line carry one shared note (`TASK_LABEL_NOTE`) that they echo an input and are not a finding. README no longer says `--task` "is not a label".
- 2b681b9: **The flows file's parser exists, and nothing can reach it yet (#2359, PR 1 of 7).** ADR 0038 designs a run that logs in to the page it examines; this is the file format it reads, refusing rather than tolerating: a closed vocabulary of seven steps with no script, no evaluated expression and no fixed sleep; `origin:` pinned so a flow written for staging cannot be aimed at production; controls addressed by accessible name and never by selector; and a login flow that takes its values from the environment only, must end in an `expect`, and captures nothing. No flag or Action input accepts a flows file until PR 7, so no run changes behaviour.
- 3ecf0cf: **The proof that a login's credential does not reach what a run writes now exists as a command, and it runs nowhere by itself yet (#2359, PR 6 of 7).** `npm run auth:leak-check` drives a real capture on the machine the worker runs on, through a fixture site whose account page either does or does not echo the username, and searches what came back and what a run would write. Exit 0 is clean, 1 a leak, 2 could not examine, and examining nothing is 2. The two fixtures give it its positive controls: against the echoing site the raw response must exit exactly 1, and the written artifacts must exit 0 with a redaction count of at least 1. No flag reaches an authenticated run until PR 7.
- 2d5bc41: **A run that needs to log in now refuses what it must, with a named error each time, and no flag can ask it to yet (#2359, PR 3 of 7).** Ten named errors join the fault table with a what / try / see entry apiece: a remote worker refuses an authentication request before anything is sent or the rule layer's browser launches; a worker whose answer lacks `authApplied: true` (an older worker that ignored the request and captured the login page) is `auth-not-applied` and never a report; authentication with `JUDGE_BACKEND` set to a vendor refuses unless `--send-authenticated-transcript-to-judge-vendor` is given, which cannot be set from the environment; and an authenticated run on a repository that is not private is refused whole. The CLI exits 2 on these, like a configuration error, and not 3 ("wait for a release"). No run changes behaviour until PR 7 makes the flags reachable.
- 1d4a5b7: **The rule layer can log in for itself, and no flag can ask it to yet (#2359, PR 5 of 7).** axe-core loads the page in the CLI's own browser, so a login performed only in the worker's Edge would leave it scanning the sign-in page and reporting on that as the product. Given a login, the rule layer now signs in in its own browser from the same environment variables, over the same accessible-name-bound steps the worker runs, and scans the page it lands on; it never receives a session from the worker. A login that fails there ends the run with `auth-login-failed` instead of being reported as "the scan failed, continuing without it", and a rule layer that fails for any other reason on an authenticated run stays "unchecked", never clean. An authenticated run whose rule layer did not run reports no page title rather than the login page's, so the capture is not judged as reading the wrong page and re-captured. No run changes behaviour until PR 7 makes the flags reachable.
- 54a0577: **The containment for a login's credentials exists, and nothing can reach it yet (#2359, PR 2 of 7).** Every value a run reads from the environment for a login will be replaced with `‹credential›` in everything the CLI writes or prints, in its raw, JSON-escaped, URL-encoded and base64 forms, with the count disclosed ("N announcements contained a value from your login and were redacted."). A rescan then runs the same detector the `auth:leak-check` command uses, including a run of four or more one-character announcements that spell part of a credential; a hit stops the run before anything is written or printed. A value shorter than 8 characters refuses the run rather than rewriting the page's own text. No flag reaches this until PR 7, so no run changes behaviour.
- a124048: **When a capture's evidence spans more than one document, the job summary, the Action's log and the CLI report now say so first.**
  Before this, the only place that said it was Conformance Requirement 2 in the JSON result. For example, a probe
  submits a search form and follows a link, and the capture's own title marks name two pages. The CLI report printed
  that sentence only in its last section, and the job summary did not print it at all.
  
  **What a report says about it.** The summary leads with Requirement 2's own sentence, above its heading:
  "THIS CAPTURE NAMED MORE THAN ONE DOCUMENT and so has no single identity — …", naming each document. The Action's
  first log line says the capture spanned more than one document. The CLI report states it under the URL and Task
  lines. A capture that named one document renders nothing new, and neither does a result with no conformance.
  
  The JSON result is unchanged: the sentence is read from the `conformance` it already carries (#1387).
- 9b6dec2: **The CLI's text report no longer prints axe findings inside an embedded frame as the page's own.** On `https://www.w3.org/WAI`, `npx a11ign` listed three violations that were all inside the embedded YouTube player, with nothing to say so. The job summary had the same defect and #1388 fixed it there.
  
  The rule-based layer's count line now splits out findings inside a frame, for example "3 violation(s), 3 inside a frame". Each such finding is marked "(in a frame; origin not examined)", and a caveat below the list says the content may be third-party. The rule and the wording are #1388's: a finding is inside a frame when its axe target crosses a frame boundary. The result does not record whose frame it is, so the report never says it IS third-party. Findings that are not inside a frame print as before (#1596).
- 6391774: **The CLI text report now says `ASSERTED` on every axe-core and PDF-layer finding, instead of leaving it to be inferred.** A reader with no accessibility background, handed the report cold, had to work out "this is a confirmed problem" from the *absence* of the `INDICATOR` tag the lived-experience layer's own findings carry -- there was no positive signal at all. Both layers read a rule match directly (the DOM for axe-core, the tag tree for PDF) rather than inferring it, the same class of claim ADR 0021's addendum already settles for axe-core, so each finding line now prints `ASSERTED` explicitly.
  
  **Bare criterion numbers now carry their plain-language name** -- "4.1.2 Name, Role, Value" instead of "4.1.2" -- in the axe-core section, the PDF section, and per-criterion outcomes. Findings from the lived-experience layer were already named at the point they're produced and are unchanged. The machine-readable `CriterionOutcome.criterion` field itself is unchanged; EARL and `--json` still read the bare number.
  
  **The legend gained one line** tying the finding-level vocabulary (`ASSERTED`/`INDICATOR`) to the outcome-level one (`asserted`/`referred`), after a blind read found the two confusing in isolation with nothing saying they're the same split (#1791).
- 405583c: **Conformance requirement 1 states the run's own examined count (#3307).** It used to give the screen-reader layer's reach ("N of 55") and send the reader to `outcomes` for the split, so a report's `conformance` and `outcomes` could not be compared. `conformanceFor` now hands the criteria axe-core returned a verdict for to `conformanceScope` (new optional `ruleLayerCovered`), and requirement 1 reads "examined N of 55: M by the screen-reader layer and scorer, K further by axe-core alone". N is the non-`untested` count of `outcomes`. Without `ruleLayerCovered`, or with no rule layer, the earlier wording stands.
- e520d29: **The job summary no longer presents axe findings inside an embedded frame as the page's own.** On `https://www.w3.org/WAI`, the page the docs recommend, the summary read "Rule layer (axe-core): 3 violation(s)". All three were inside the embedded YouTube player. The run artifact's conformance block said third-party content is not distinguished from the author's own, but the report never repeated it.
  
  The rule layer's count line now splits out rows inside a frame, for example "3 violation(s), 3 inside a frame". Each such row is marked "in a frame; origin not examined", and a caveat beside the table says the content may be third-party. A row is treated as inside a frame when its axe target crosses a frame boundary. The result does not record whose frame it is, so the report never says it IS third-party. Findings that are not inside a frame render as before (#1388).
- 55f5a90: **The Action's log line and job summary no longer present a referred finding as a failure of its severity.** On rehearsal 2's page, the one lived-experience finding was a referral: the judge maps it `secondary`, and the criterion's outcome is `cantTell`. The log still read "1 finding(s) (1 serious)", and nothing in the summary said it was a referral.
  
  The log line now counts referrals apart from assertions, for example "1 finding(s) (1 referred)" or "3 finding(s) (2 asserted: 1 serious, 1 moderate; 1 referred)". Severities break down assertions only. In the summary's findings table each referral reads "referred" beside its severity, with a note saying what that means. A finding asserts only when the judge maps it `conformance`; absent or `secondary` refers, which is how the CLI's text report already tags each finding. `fail-on` is unchanged (#1366).
- f22ae6e: Documentation-only: example commands and test fixtures now point at `a11ign/a11ign` instead of the pre-transfer `DanBeckDev/a11y-witness`, so copying them resolves to the repository's current location.
  
  - `packages/cli/README.md`'s example workflow's `uses:` line.
  - `packages/nvda-worker/src/README.md`'s `git clone` step.
  - `packages/judge/src/documented-criteria.test.ts`'s fixtures and comments, which assert the README's own snippet.
  
  No code, wire protocol, or capture behaviour changed.
- e9c2592: **The CLI text report's legend now glosses its four remaining unexplained terms.** A reader with no accessibility background, handed the report cold, could classify findings and outcomes correctly but could not say what the confidence number meant, what the `Support` line was telling them, what `ACT` stood for, or what the `§5.x` citations pointed at (#1802's own closing blind-read named these four as still unglossed).
  
  The legend (`howToReadThisSection`) now explains, in the order the report uses them: the 0-1 confidence scale and that "overall confidence" is the WEAKEST finding, not an average; that the `Support` line is a check on the scorer's own confidence rather than a finding about the page, and what OUTSIDE means; that `ACT` is W3C's Accessibility Conformance Testing framework; and that `§5.2`/`§5.3` are WCAG's own section numbers. Nothing machine-readable changes -- no new field, no `ActOutcome`, no `--json` output.
- 5fc1013: **The CLI text report now explains the two number pairs its own blind readers flagged as looking contradictory, and glosses the two remaining bare instrument names.** #1851 closed the confidence scale, `Support`, `ACT` and `§5.x`; two fresh readers against that same fixture, unprompted, both flagged four further things: `domCensus`'s `formField` count reading far lower than the activation probe's "form control(s) found" (they count different alphabets — one a narrow DOM selector, the other every stop the screen reader's own quick-navigation key made over a wider role set); a `Reach` ratio where the first number EXCEEDS the second (the sweep and the census can legitimately disagree, and that must not share a sentence with a genuine shortfall on a different type); the rule-based layer's own severity words and the lived-experience layer's own severity words being two separate scales, not one ranking; and `guidepup`/`domCensus` appearing as bare names.
  
  `packages/evidence/src/conformance.ts`: `activationSentence` now notes, only when the render line prints a `formField` figure, that the count is a different and wider alphabet. `coverageSentence` now names a type whose reach exceeds its census as fine, separately from any type that genuinely fell short, instead of letting one shortfall caveat read over both. `packages/cli/src/report.ts`'s shared legend (`howToReadThisSection`) now states the two severity scales are separate, glosses `guidepup` and `domCensus`, and says why only `asserted`/`referred` criteria are listed by name. Nothing machine-readable changes — no new field, no `ActOutcome`, no `--json` output, no census/coverage arithmetic.
- 5bcaec2: **The CLI text report now glosses bare sweep-stop codes and states what the Support line's number measures.** #1855's own closing blind-read named two more bare terms out of its Region and declined to widen scope to fix them: a sweep-stop code like `deadline`/`channelReset`/`focusModeStuck`, printed bare in the "Full pages" conformance-requirement sentence, and the Support line's cosine-similarity number, printed with no stated scale.
  
  `packages/evidence/src/conformance.ts`: `fullPages()`'s truncated-sweep detail string now appends one plain-language gloss per stop code (`exhausted`/`repeat` are excluded -- those mean the page ran out, not us). `packages/cli/src/report.ts`'s shared legend (`howToReadThisSection`) now states the Support number is a cosine similarity to the closest training page, from -1 to 1, with the scorer's own training pages named as a reference band. Nothing machine-readable changes -- no new field, no `--json` output change.
- b05a296: **The job summary now shows a state change the screen reader announced correctly, as evidence observed.**
  When a disclosure control is announced `collapsed`, activated, and then announced `expanded` (or the reverse),
  the report quotes both announcements under "Evidence observed". Before this, a run could collect exactly that
  evidence and the report said nothing about it. The line never names a WCAG criterion or says anything passed: one
  control behaving correctly is not a result for the page.
  
  **`@a11ign/judge/rules` exports `announcedStateChanges(changes)`.** It lists the state-change pairs whose state
  changed, read through the same checks as the `4.1.2:state-change-silent` rule: a role whose activation is Enter,
  the same control named before and after, and an expandable state on both sides. A combo box, a pair naming two
  different controls, or a pair without an expandable state is never listed, exactly as the rule never reads it.
  The rule's own findings are unchanged.
- 3af2fa0: **A precedence reason now names the axe rule that violated the criterion (#1606).** Where axe-core's violation outranks or disagrees with the screen-reader layer on a criterion both cover (#1342), the reason read "axe-core reported a violation of 2.4.4". It now reads "axe-core reported link-name as a violation of 2.4.4", naming every violating rule. **Breaking for a consumer of `@a11ign/judge/outcomes`:** each `RuleLayerCoverage` entry is now `{ verdict, rules }` (the new `RuleLayerEntry` type) instead of a bare verdict string. `rules` lists the axe rule ids that violated the criterion, and is empty for a criterion that was not violated.
- 2af978b: **A saved state that signs the screen reader in is no longer reported as expired because the rule layer's browser was refused it (#2788, #2566, ADR 0038 amendment 8).** On a site that ties a session to the browser that made it, the same `--auth-state` file signed the screen reader's Edge in and was refused by the rule layer's own headless browser, and the run ended `auth-state-expired` with the advice to sign in again, which gives the same result. On a state run the rule layer now launches the system Edge first and presents itself as the worker's browser (its own `User-Agent` without the headless marker, and `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9`). If the rule layer's browser is still refused a state the screen reader's accepted, the run ends with a new fault, `auth-state-refused-by-rule-layer`, which says the state is not expired and offers `--no-axe` (the Action's `axe: false`) or `--login-flow`; a state both browsers refuse is still `auth-state-expired`. Not yet read on a real runner.
- 38015bc: **A saved-state run no longer reports pressing the login's controls, or performing a login (#2787, #2566 item 6, ADR 0038 amendment 9).** `--auth-state` skips every login step but the final `expect:`, yet `a11ign-summary.md` read "What this run pressed: Login" and the result carried `logins: { performed: 1 }` beside a notice saying the run performs no login. The pressed list now omits the login's steps under a state (the flow's and a forms config's stay), and the `logins` tally counts none and states a minimum of 0. A run with no state is unchanged.
- 97def29: **The containment for a saved storage state exists before the flag that loads one (ADR 0038, amendment 7, #2566).** Nothing is reachable yet: there is still no `--auth-state`. `scrub.ts` gains `credentialsFromState`, which turns the cookies and `localStorage` a run would load for its pinned origin into values to hide (named by place, `state cookie 3`, never by the file's key or value; a JSON `localStorage` value contributes the strings inside it), and `stateEntriesFor`, the one selection that the later loading is to be built from too. **A value shorter than `MIN_SCRUBBED_LENGTH` is skipped and counted, not refused** (a real state holds many such values), and so is a value that is text the run was itself handed (its URLs or task); `stateScrubNotices` says how many. A new test enumerates every file write under `packages/cli/src/auth/` and in the worker's login against an allowlist of one, and a scratch module that writes a state is caught by the same scan, so the tool provably writes no state file. **Not done:** loading a state, the `auth-state-expired` fault, the worker's wire, the Action's `auth-state:` input, and the real reading on a runner (row item 6).
- a3cfdd7: **The Action's summary now lists the controls a non-authenticated run pressed, by name (#3297).** On the default settings, `probe-forms` submits forms with no valid input and `probe-navigation` follows a link, and the comment said none of it: a run against gov.uk submitted the search form empty twice and toggled two sort radios, and the reader rebuilt that from `interaction.formChanges` in the JSON. The summary now has a **What this run pressed on its own** section, one line per control as the screen reader announced it (never a value), capped at the summary's row limit with the remainder counted, and says where a submit took the run. An authenticated run still lists its own whole `pressed` list, unchanged.
- 765fd1a: **When criteria rest on an examination known to be partial, the Action's log and job summary now count them.**
  Before this, only the JSON result said so, in each such criterion's `outcomes[*].reason`. Rehearsal 2's result
  carried eight of them, and its log read `a11ign: 1 finding(s) (1 serious)` with no word of any.
  
  **What a report says about it.** The log adds `a11ign: N criteria rest on an examination known to be partial --
  see the artifact` above its count of findings. The job summary's **Not determined** line counts those criteria
  apart from the other referrals. A result where no sweep stopped short renders nothing new, and neither does a
  result with no outcomes.
  
  The JSON result is unchanged: the count is read from the `outcomes` it already carries (#1563).
- adec6f7: **The package's own README no longer tells a reader that `npx a11ign` does not work.** Its banner described a package that was not yet on the registry, on the page npm shows for one that has been there since 2026-09-19. It now says the command works and still needs a Windows machine with NVDA. No code changed.
- 3112a28: **`npx a11ign` on a machine with no worker and no UTM VM no longer prints a notice about a UTM VM.** The run printed `DEPRECATED: this run (no worker named, no fleet configured) manages a local UTM worker VM`, and pointed at a `CLAUDE.md` that is not in the install, before it had looked for a VM; nothing was managed, and the run went on to the same "No capture worker answered" refusal. The notice is now printed only when a local VM is found, so a Mac that still has a UTM guest is still told.
- 560d8d3: **The GitHub Action's log now says so when its count is bounded by an incomplete examination or an abstention (#3295).** On `https://www.gov.uk/` (run 37134253796) the log read only `0 finding(s) (none); fail-on=never`, though the result recorded that the focus-order sweep stopped at its cap and the scorer abstained on every criterion, so a reader who greps the log for the count saw a clean zero. A line before the count now names the stopped sweeps (`examination INCOMPLETE`) and, separately, the abstention; a complete, scored examination prints exactly the lines it did before, as `docs/try-it.md` already described.
- 318a375: **The Quickstart in the package README copies the Node 24 action majors (#3315).** Its `actions/checkout` step was still `@v4`, so a workflow copied from the npm page opened with the same "Node.js 20 is deprecated" annotation the Action's own guide had already stopped producing (#3298). It now reads `actions/checkout@v7`; nothing the CLI does has changed.
