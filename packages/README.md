# `packages/`

`PLAN.md`'s multi-package split. M1 built the scaffolding **before** anything moved into it, so the
enforcement was in place before the code could drift against it.

**Renamed under [ADR 0036](../docs/adr/0036-the-layer-model.md), ahead of the `a11ign` rename (#66): a
package is either PRODUCT (layer-neutral) or LAYER (names the evidence source it belongs to), and a layer
package's name says which layer.** Today's only real layer is the screen reader; `evidence` and `judge`
decide across whichever layers exist and so name none of them.

| package | new scope | licence | contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `evidence` (M2) | `@a11ign/evidence` — product | Apache-2.0 | wire types (`.`), pure verification predicates (`./verify`), the WCAG 2.2 AA list (`./wcag`) — zero deps, no I/O |
| `scorer` (M3) | `@a11ign/screenreader-scorer` — screen-reader layer | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the trained heads, the training report, the Python scoring program and the feature contract. The weights are the API, so a retrain is a major bump |
| `judge` (M4) | `@a11ign/judge` — product | AGPL-3.0-or-later | `judge()` (`.`), the deterministic absence rules (`./rules`), experience-layer ordering (`./layers` — a DIFFERENT "layer" from ADR 0036's, see that ADR's own collision note), and `./internal` with no semver guarantee |
| `nvda-worker` (M5) | `@a11ign/screenreader-worker` — screen-reader layer | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the Windows capture worker. `.mjs` ships verbatim, so no build step; the HTTP contract is the API and `CAPTURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` versions it independently of semver |
| `worker-fleet` (M6) | `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet` — screen-reader layer | AGPL-3.0-or-later | host-side lease/health/capacity, the `a11ign-doctor` and `a11y-worker-*` bins, and the UTM provisioning scripts. Touches no NVDA |
| `a11ign` (M7) | **`a11ign`, unscoped** — product | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the CLI. Stays unscoped so `npx a11ign` needs no wrapper — ADR 0036 rejected `@a11ign/cli` for exactly this reason. Exports `reportLines` only; the root package was renamed to `a11ign-monorepo` to free the name |
| `pdf` | `@a11ign/pdf` — the PDF layer | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the second layer (#68, `ceo`'s ruling on #1131): reads a PDF's own accessibility tag tree directly — tagged/untagged, document language, alt text on `Figure` elements — with `pdf-lib`, no browser, no NVDA and no fleet |

**`pdf` joined after M1–M8 rather than inside them** — the migration above renamed what already existed;
`pdf` is the first package ADR 0036's "a new layer joins by the same contract" clause was ever tested
against, added once the contract itself (this document) existed to join.

**Three more exist and are deliberately absent from the migration table above** — that table is M1–M8's
*published* split; these are `"private": true` and never reach the registry:

| package | new scope | licence | contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent-org` | `@a11ign/agent-org` — the organisation, private | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the AI agent org that develops this repo: rows and claims, the board and tracker, the merge queue, the trunk and merge guards, and the wake gate. Ships nothing and runs nowhere but this project — it is the half of `scripts/` that was never about the product, and ADR 0008 named it without giving it a home |
| `guards` | `@a11ign/guards` — repo hygiene, private today | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the refusals that are about ENGINEERING PRACTICE rather than about this product: mutation-check, the emptiness and piped-exit lint rules, the tree-wide guard registry, walk-scope declarations, the changed-files helper and the isolation gate. Plain `.mjs` exported from `src` with no build step (ADR 0031's shape), so a pre-`npm ci` entry point can import one without a `dist` existing |
| `control` | unchanged, private | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the control plane: holds the fleet SSH key, dispatches work to the fleet and to `lab`. Dependency-free by design — [ADR 0012](../docs/adr/0012-control-plane-split.md) |
| `lab` | unchanged, private | AGPL-3.0-or-later | the eval harness, the training corpus pipeline, the release gates and the analysis programs. Ships nothing |
| `nvda-speech` | `@a11ign/screenreader-speech` — screen-reader layer, private today | GPL-3.0-or-later | NVDA's announcement composition, ported to run without Windows — GPL because it is derived from NVDA, so `evidence` (Apache-2.0) must never import it. Named for publication now so it does not need renaming twice if it is ever published |

`control` and `lab` keep plain names under ADR 0036's rule too: the naming rule governs published names,
and neither reaches the registry.

The order is deliberate. M0 tested the assumption that could invalidate the whole design — that a consumer
can install and run one package in isolation — and its findings are in `docs/isolation-spike.md`. M1 adds
the machinery. Only then do M2–M8 move files, each with a gate that compares a result to the previous one
rather than asking a human to judge.

## What is already here

| piece | where | why now |
|---|---|---|
| workspace root | `package.json` `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` | npm workspaces, not pnpm — `workspace:*` is rejected by npm 11.5.1 with `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` (ADR 0005, measured) |
| shared build options | `tsconfig.base.json` | `composite: true` so project references make the dependency graph compiler-enforced |
| the isolation gate | `packages/guards/src/isolation-gate.mjs`, `npm run gate:isolation` | packs a package, installs it **outside the repo**, runs its smoke test |
| proof the gate works | `scripts/isolation-fixtures/` | one sound package it must accept, two broken ones it must reject |

## The contract every package follows

**`"prepack": "tsc --build"` is mandatory, not tidiness.** `npm pack` does not build, so without it the
tarball ships an empty `dist` on any machine that has not built first — every clean clone, every CI job.
Demonstrated rather than assumed: with `dist` deleted, the isolation gate failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`,
and passed once `prepack` existed. `"prepare"` runs the same build after `npm install`, so the root
`typecheck` resolves the package's `.d.ts` without a separate step.

Each package under `packages/` owns an `isolation-smoke.mjs` that imports itself **by package name** and
exercises the first example in its README. The gate copies it into a throwaway consumer directory next to
the installed tarball and runs it there. Importing by name rather than by path is the whole point: a
relative import would resolve inside the repo and prove nothing.

## The gate packs a package's unpublished siblings too

`judge` is the first package with internal dependencies, and it exposed an omission: nothing is published, so
npm cannot fetch `@a11ign/evidence` from the registry — the install fails with E404 and the gate reports
a broken package that is fine. npm 7+ auto-installs **peer** dependencies as well, so a peer on an unpublished
sibling fails identically.

The gate now packs the whole internal closure and installs the tarballs together, which is the composition it
should have been testing from the start: a consumer installs `judge` *and* the `scorer` it peers on, and the
two must work together outside the workspace. `evidence` and `scorer` are leaves, so this was invisible until
M4. A dependency on a sibling that is not a package in this repo is an error rather than a silent fall-through
to the registry.

## Why the gate has to exist at all

A workspace install resolves everything by symlink, with the repo root as cwd, so **the workspace is
structurally incapable of detecting** the failures that matter to a consumer: phantom dependencies that
npm's hoisting permits, cwd-relative path resolution, assets an over-tight `"files"` allow-list drops, and
`"exports"` subpaths that do not resolve.

This is not hypothetical here. M0 found `local-judge.ts` resolving the scorer relative to the process cwd,
and the scorer program itself missing from the repo while every local run succeeded — because **`npm pack`
includes untracked files**, so "it worked when I installed it" was never evidence.

M2 then earned it twice over on the first real package. The gate rejected `@a11ign/evidence` three
times before accepting it, and every rejection was a genuine defect in what a consumer would have received:
the README's first example used a field name the contract does not have (`announcements`, not `transcript`),
it asserted the wrong `Criterion` key (`id`, not `num`), and the tarball shipped no `dist` at all. A
documented example that does not run is the same class of defect as a check that examines nothing — which is
why the smoke test exercises the README rather than something convenient.
