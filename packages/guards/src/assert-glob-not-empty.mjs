// command: refuse a test glob that resolves to zero files instead of passing silently
// `npm test` PASSES, exit 0, if the glob it hands to `tsx --test` resolves to zero files (#355) --
//
//   $ npx tsx --test "packages/lab/src/packaging/nothing-matches-*.test.ts"; echo "EXIT=$?"
//   EXIT=0    ℹ tests 0  ℹ pass 0  ℹ fail 0
//
// A LITERAL missing path fails correctly (`tsx --test` errors "Could not find ..."); a QUOTED GLOB that
// matches nothing is globbed by the runner itself and reported as a clean, empty pass -- which is exactly
// the form `test:ts` and `pre-push` both use, because an unquoted glob would otherwise be expanded by the
// shell before either script sees it, and `zsh` errors on no match while `bash` (CI's shell) passes the
// literal pattern straight through unexpanded.
//
// EVERY VACUITY GUARD THIS REPO HAS IS INSIDE A FILE THE GLOB WOULD HAVE LOADED. A guard cannot fire from
// inside the thing that failed to load -- the same shape as a diagnostic that cannot report itself. So
// this floor has to live OUTSIDE the suite: a plain script, run BEFORE `tsx --test` is ever invoked,
// never another `*.test.ts` (that is the defect this row exists to end, one level further in).
//
//   node packages/guards/src/assert-glob-not-empty.mjs <glob...> [--min=N]                 -- check only
//   node packages/guards/src/assert-glob-not-empty.mjs <glob...> [--min=N] [--drop-empty] --run [--runner=tsx|rstest] [--test-concurrency=N]
//
// Each glob given is resolved independently and must match at least `--min` files (default 1 -- "not
// vacuous", never "exactly this many"). A directory rename, a package restructure, or #66's tree-wide
// rename to `a11ign` breaking a path glob is exactly the ordinary change this is built to catch, on the
// day it happens rather than as a silent, green no-op.
//
// `--run` EXECUTES `tsx --test` on the SAME `<glob...>` ARGV THIS PROCESS PARSED, rather than checking one
// copy of the pattern and leaving the caller to write a second copy for the real invocation. A `--run`-less
// version of this shipped first and looked complete: `test:ts` read
// `npm run test:glob-check && tsx --test "<pattern>"`, the SAME literal typed twice in one JSON string.
// Mutating ONLY the second copy -- exactly the shape of an ordinary future edit, someone widening the real
// glob and not noticing the separate check line -- passed `test:glob-check` (which still validated the
// FIRST, unmutated copy) and then silently zero-test-passed the actual suite, reproducing #355 through the
// fix meant to close it. "A fact stated twice" (this file's own CLAUDE.md section) applies to a shell
// command's own argv, not only to prose. `--run` makes the two uses of the pattern the same JS array.
