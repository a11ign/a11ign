// command: detect a piped command whose exit status was read from the wrong side of the pipe
/**
 * Detects the shape behind issue #180: `cmd | head` (or `| tail`, `| grep`) reports the STATUS TOOL's
 * exit code, not the piped command's — so `$?` read afterward names the wrong thing. Measured twice in
 * one night, once an hour after the first was diagnosed and warned about: `agent-org merge-guard
 * 148 | head -4; echo EXIT=$?` printed `EXIT=0` for a command that actually exited 2.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. A pipeline ending in head/tail/grep is only hazardous when something AFTER it
 * reads `$?` — `cat README.md | head -5` with nothing reading its status is completely fine, and is not
 * flagged. This is a heuristic over shell TEXT, not a real shell parser: it cannot see `set -o pipefail`
 * unless the same string mentions it, and it cannot see a `$?` read that a variable or function hides.
 * That is the tradeoff the issue itself calls for — measuring the real population first (38 pipe-to-
 * head/tail/grep sites across .sh/.mjs/.yml on 2026-09-07, none of them this hazard) rather than shipping
 * a remedy that fires on legitimate use and gets disabled.
 *
 * #535: NO WORKSPACE IMPORT, DELIBERATELY. This file used to import `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet/cli-flags` for
 * its own unknown-flag guard, and that import is exactly what broke it: `pre-commit` invokes this script
 * in EVERY worktree, including one created before `node_modules` is symlinked in, and there the import
 * throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` -- which pre-commit's `>/dev/null 2>&1` swallowed and misread as a hazard
 * on every single staged line (`fi`, `else`, `run: |`, prose comments -- none of them pipe anything).
 * `scripts/check-schema-migration.ts` is this repo's own precedent for the identical bind (it is copied
 * into a throwaway directory with no `node_modules` by its own gate test) -- its one flag is checked with
 * a bare `process.argv.includes(...)`, no workspace import, and this file now does the same.
 *
 * #375: `checkPipedExitStatus` alone is WHOLE-TEXT — it flattens every `;`/`&&`/`||`/newline-separated
 * statement in whatever text it is given into ONE list and asks "does ANY of them read `$?`", with no
 * notion of which FUNCTION a statement lives in. Fine for a single diff LINE (pre-commit's own use, one
 * statement or a short chain, never more than one function's worth of text) and wrong for a whole FILE:
 * `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push` pipes into `grep` in `note_if_untouched()` and reads `$?` correctly,
 * redirected to a file, in the UNRELATED `run()` function -- and the flattened check reads the second as
 * answering the first. `checkPipedExitStatusInText` below scopes each hazard determination to the
 * FUNCTION it was found in (or the top-level code before any function), by running the existing,
 * UNCHANGED per-block logic independently per function -- so a single-statement or single-function input
 * (everything `checkPipedExitStatus` was ever called with before this) behaves identically, and only a
 * multi-function file stops bleeding across the boundary.
