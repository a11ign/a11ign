/**
 * #1185: A `git` SPAWN MUST GO THROUGH A GIT_* SCRUBBING HELPER, REPORTED AT THE SPAWN.
 *
 * git EXPORTS `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`/`GIT_INDEX_FILE` into every hook environment. On 2026-09-06 the
 * pre-push hook ran `npm test` with `GIT_DIR` set, and a test that spawned git with `cwd` alone and an
 * inherited `env` operated on the REAL repository: `core.bare` flipped twice, stray commits landed on real
 * refs, and a test's own `git config user.name` was reused as author on 15 commits, six already on
 * `origin/main`.
 *
 * CONVERTED FROM `git-spawn-classification.test.ts` (#908), and the measurement is why a rule rather than
 * a sweep: **79 of 79 files spawning git already import a canonical helper.** The guard has no findings to
 * make and only a line to hold, which is exactly where a sweep earns least -- it runs once in the PR suite
 * and fails far from the call -- and a rule earns most: every `npm run lint`, at the spawn's own line,
 * refusing a new file as it is written rather than on the next run.
 *
 * THE AST IS WHY COMMENTS CANNOT COUNT. The sweep strips comments to avoid matching prose that quotes
 * `execFileSync("git", ...)`; three such comments exist in this tree and a regex over raw source reads all
 * three as spawns -- measured while scoping this row, which is the defect the sweep's own header warns of.
 * A rule asking the syntax cannot make that mistake at all.
 *
 * WHAT DELETES THIS RULE, which #908 requires naming: one helper that spawns git with the environment
 * sandboxed inside it, so a raw spawn has no caller. With adoption already complete that is a refactor of
 * call sites rather than a rescue, and this rule is what keeps the number at 79 until someone does it.
