// `packages/guards/src/tree-wide-guard.mjs`'s marker -- a guard whose population is the whole repository rather than
// one file, so its own green run on a PR's diff is not a prediction: #704. #716 measured 21 such files at
// 141.3s together and made five of them (138 of the 141) fast, so the pre-push hook can run every one of

// IMPORT-BASED, never a grep -- ceo's ruling 2026-09-09, after a comment-aware text-grep for "ls-files"
// (this file's own first version) still counted as "a test deriving its expectations from source TEXT",
// this repo's own most-repeated defect shape. `localImports` (`local-import-closure.mjs`, #621/B8) parses
// real ES import statements, comment-stripped -- the same discipline that lets B8 derive a test's
// requirements from its import closure rather than scanning it for a keyword a future guard might not
// happen to spell. See `tree-wide-guard.mjs`'s own header for why the check is IMPORT AND CALL, never the
// import alone.
