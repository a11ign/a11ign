// @ts-check
// command: (not a command) the ESLint rule for #1155, imported by eslint.config.js
// AN EMPTINESS ASSERTION ON A LOCALLY DERIVED COLLECTION, WITH NOTHING PINNING WHAT IT WAS DERIVED FROM.
//
// `assert.deepEqual(offenders, [])` where `const offenders = files.filter(...)` is satisfied by an EMPTY
// `files`. The control belongs on `files`, and pinning `offenders` proves nothing -- it is the subject,
// not the population. #1123 measured 226 such assertions across 135 files and, more usefully, measured
// that they are not one population: 73 accumulators, 64 derived-local, 64 derived-from-a-call, and 35
// other. **The remedy differs per shape**, which is why `ceo` ruled a rule for the derived-local 64 only.
//
// ## What this rule deliberately does NOT do
//
// **The receiver must be an IDENTIFIER.** `const xs = f().filter(...)` is out of scope by that same
// ruling: the rule can see the shape and cannot see the population, because what `f()` returns is not
// here. Flagging it would produce a report nobody can act on except by restructuring the test, and a rule
// whose remedy is "write it differently" is a style rule wearing a correctness rule's name.
//
// **Accumulators are out of scope and are the bigger half.** `const xs = []; for (...) xs.push(...)`
// needs its control on the LOOP'S SOURCE, which is neither the asserted name nor its initialiser. #1123
// has its own row for defining that before anything is built for it.
//
// **The pin must be in the SAME TEST.** A `assert.ok(files.length)` in a neighbouring test does not
// control this one -- they run independently and either could be the one that stops examining anything.
// Searching the whole file would let one pin excuse every assertion in it, which is the shape where a
// control on the wrong object reads as a control.
//
// ## And why the exemption is by NAME rather than by cleverness
//
// `git-population-vacuity.test.ts` contains an emptiness assertion that CANNOT fail, deliberately: it
// reproduces the naive check -- *"0 checked, 0 missing"* -- to demonstrate that a check which examined
// nothing and a check which examined everything produce the same sentence. **That is a demonstration of
// this rule's defect inside the guard file for this rule's defect**, and it must stay exactly as it is.
//
// It is exempted BY NAME in the config, with the reason written there. **A rule clever enough to
// recognise a demonstration is a rule that will excuse a real one** -- the recognition would have to key
// on something a real defect can also carry (a comment, a name, a shape), and then the next author gets
// the exemption by accident. #1123's own measurement is the argument: all six assertions in the purest
// bucket read as defects and all six were correct, so the shape does not decide it and a human must.
